Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.

The kid said --

Leave me alone -- !

But his mother --

I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?

I don't know.

A letter? May I see it?

Is that all? Can I go now?

And this?

Why, do you think we're going to?

No, you see, I don't really love him.

I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.

Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.

You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.

Starting tonight?

Having a nervous breakdown.

Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.

How do you shave in there?

How about once more around the park?

Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.

Good night.

Be careful, Peter.

I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.

Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.

I believe what he said.

Words can hurt very much.

Please stop -- please!

Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?

Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.

Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.

Who invited you?

We want that money -- now!

Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.

WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?

Not my imports.

Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?

Calm down Brent.

Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

You never went, uh, all the way?

Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.

No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.

You know where I can find her?

I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.

No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?

Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?

Yeah. You should check downstairs.

People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.

I'm sure you should have failed.

Of course I'm scared.

I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.

But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.

Does she fuck?

I was desperate. It was gross.

Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.

I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.

There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.

FINE. Are you?

You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?

No.

So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.

Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.

I did.

I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.

Sharon's far from a slut.

He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!

Yes?

No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.

Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.

The word is Mob.

The men. Do any of them still live around here?

You're not telling me something.

Who was the fourth?

Did you want one?

They're tasty.

Maybe you better just drive me home.

Yes. Unfair to me.

Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.

Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.





Andy.  Another fuckin'...

Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 

Except for the fact that I need cash.

...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...

Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

...and a shitload of ice.



You want cash?

No.

Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...

Are you kiddin'?

You'd better coast through...



...-er.

Borrowed.

Okay, okay! 

You're nuts, goin' back there!



Hi--!  The gun was empty!

Well, then, that means it's call...

...man!



...Pete!  Come on!  There it...

All right, you got it.

  Oh, we're screwed, Night...



Come on!

 Oh...

Come on.

...Pete!  Come on.

...Night Shift, but you might...

...you crazy bastard.

Whoo!

 Gee, you think so?

 ...shit!

 

Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 

I'm crazy?



This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...

You're fucked, man.

...stole the truck.

...piece of shit was worth.

Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.

Even though it is nice to see Andy...

Are you all right?



We're gonna die!

 Come on!

Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.



Okay.

Tunnel.

What?



It's working.



Look out.

Why'd you stay behind?!

They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 

...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.

What about all that "no need to get in the man's...

Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...

But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.

That's bullshit.

 big balls.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

...help you?

  Hey, actually...

...-lem too?

Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!



Any of them Richard Long?

If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...

You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...

...destroyer of worlds."

No!

There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.

You look good, Richard.

Is that why you're here?  To blame...

Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.

Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...

...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.

Forget about him.

And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.

Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?

Like I say, Doc Long's...

Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.



It won't be long, gentlemen.









Where's Elvis?!





You'd never understand!

Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...

Secrets.

You got thirty minutes.

Go.

Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.

...that the prey can bite back.

We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.

Yeah, yeah...

Yeah.

Do you recognize this young man?

Who's the investigating officer?

Do you know him?

Where from?

Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?

Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.

His girlfriend?

You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?

Yeah.

When was the last time?

I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.

Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.

At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?

Just bring your checkbook.

You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.

Thanks. You know something, Jake?

You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.

Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.

How'd you get past the guards?

Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?

Who?

Didn't you call?

You accusing me of extortion?

Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.

Shut up.  Go on.

What for?

Do me a favor, will you, Lou?

I guess not.

But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?

Well yes.

I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.

I said I'll drop it.

You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

Well, how much would you like?

How did you find out?

Did he know?

No. I'm just a snoop.

No, not for that one.

Been meaning to talk to you about that.

Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.

No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...

No.

And Hollis knew about it?

They can't be.

What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?

You can't always tell what's going on there.

Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.

He owns it. You know?

That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.

Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?

...That's not what I meant.

I'm all right.

He's in the dark room.

What'd you expect? That's his job.

When did you come in?

Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.

Of course.

We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.

I don't think so. Be happy to show you.

J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.

Maybe he takes it very seriously.

Hope so. He's working for us.

Only when I breathe.

Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.

Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.

Drowned, too.

Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?

Who?

Mr. Gittes...

Yeah, I'll do that.

Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.

I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.

I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.

No, you have a press agent do it.

She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.

You must be thinking of a different daughter.

We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?

So I can have these? 

I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 

Then why don't you change jobs? 

For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.

Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.

I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!

Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...

Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 

We'll talk about that later.

That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...

The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...

Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.

Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!

It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!

I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.

Two cents.

Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.

I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -

These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -

You don't really think so?

Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.

That's a long story.

And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?

Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -

I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.

It didn't end very well, did it?

I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -

Yes.

I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?

Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.

Mr. Kane is finishing it.

Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.

I don't my plans myself.

That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.

Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -

That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!

We've got a nice plant here.

Has he said when he'll finish?

Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -

I'm surprised he got the votes he did.

Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.

He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -

I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?

You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.

If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -

You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.

You're no Venus de Milo.

No.  But you're close.

You really don't know who I am?

Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.

Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.

Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.

That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -

Half past eleven.

I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -

You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.

Susan!

I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!

Thanks.

Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -

Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?

They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -

All right.

Do you know what that is?

How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?

Yes?

Go ahead.

That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?

She's going to leave you -

Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?

Yes.

Mr. Leland sent back that check.

It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.

Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.

You won't be lonely, Charles...

You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?

Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.

It's a letter from her lawyers.

That must have been love.

Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.

Yes, sir.

Queer?

He married you, didn't he?

Rosebud?

What is this, a poll?

Do you mind if I drink this here?

You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!

Exactly.

He went home to change for the big date.

I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.

No, don't!

Dante. You've got a customer.

I can't believe you're here.

Very dramatic, I thought.

Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?

How do you know that?

So you're really getting married?

Thanks for the vote of confidence.

What?

Jesus, you're caustic.

Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.

I'm just kidding.

I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.

It wasn't me.

Was it you?

Nobody. It was closed.

We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.

I can pass!

I can whip your ass.

Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.

"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.

This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.

I thought Redding had like three balls!

Bunch of savages in this town.

Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.

What do you two fight about?

That's cheating?

You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.

Blasphemy.

All right, Vader's boss...

Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.

Basically.

All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?

He said he has to find a perfect dozen.

I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.

Can we talk about this later?

How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?

Let's hear it.

Can you believe this?!

Sorry.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?

Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.

I'm going with you.

You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!

Bible truth.

No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.

I never tried it.

So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!

Exactly.

I don't; you did.

I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.

Because I'm happy.

I'm not. She just left.

I'm not.

No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.

Shut the fuck up!

WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?

What are you talking about?

Leave me alone.

Jesus H. Christ, I can't!

Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.

Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.

Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.

Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.

I don't have love handles.

You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...

Jesus Christ, what next?

What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.

Yeah?

I'm not dealing.

It's not my store.

So.

I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.

I don't know. I wasn't watching.

We were going to start again, I think.

I'm trying.

Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.

I'm not even supposed to be here today!

The guy got sick and couldn't come in.

Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!

Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?

Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.

Why do you say that?

Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.

Three including you.

I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.

After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.

Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.

Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...

Please calm down.

Lower your voice!

Um. Thirty-seven.

Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.

At least he wasn't thirty-six.

I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!

I don't want Caitlin...

I don't want to go back with her...

Veronica, I love you...

Can I have your name please?

An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.

He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.

I don't know. I can't really tell from here.

My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.

Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.

You're gonna be at John K's party?

Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.

Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.

Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?

You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.

Says who?

Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.

Twenty bucks.

Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?

Do you still talk to Sylvan?

More bang for the buck.

Where's the radio?

A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.

No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!

I was with Jessie, she filled me in.

When we get this group down, I'm gone.

And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!

Would you?

Give him the money.

Not on that leg.

That's it, you look like a professional.

Patience my love, patience.

Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?

Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.

Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.

I don't expect you to understand.

You couldn't.

Why are you yelling?

Flare up of old emotions...

No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.

He doesn't want my help.

He can handle it.

You got to go back now!

Excuse me?

Of course I do.

Get it!

I don't know.  I don't know.

Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.

RUN, DAMMIT!!

I burned it.

Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.

The best he can since you gave him nothing.

No, he's gone.

We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.

I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.

What are you talking about?

Tucker and Walker.

It looks like a winding route.

Then it's a deal.

On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.

Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.

Let's move your ass in there!!

I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.

Then go fetch.

Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.

No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.

A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.

You bastards... bastards.

And you, sir?

Thank you, sir.

Who are they, sir?

How do you do, sir?

I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.

Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.

Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.

To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.

That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?

That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.

Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.

Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.

Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.

Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?

I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h

You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.

Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.

Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?

Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.

Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.

Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.

One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?

Shut your bleedin' hole!!!

How're you feeling this morning?

What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?

I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.

Fine. Fine.

Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?

That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.

Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.

Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?

Yes.

Good. I'm glad

Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.

Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.

The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.

Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.

Prison custody?

Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.

I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.

No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.

What?

I used to play this piece back in high school.

Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.

You psychic?

Just had one.

Sure thing.

Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...

It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...

In my office?

Seventh, files section.  What should I do?

Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?

You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?

Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.

I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?

Can't say that I do.

I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.

Wouldn't dream of it.

Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...

...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...

So?

No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.

Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.

Oh?

Pick me up in five minutes.

Not our call, Phil.

What happens if you don't?

Who the hell is this?

...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...

You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.

You mean like benefits?

Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.

Two, two-fifty.

You always stutter?

You're cool.

Yeah.

...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.

Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!

How can you kill him like that?

You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.

I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...

Why?

It was an accident.  I'm not liable.

I need the job.

What?

I don't understand...

You mind?  I'm working here.

Leave me alone.

<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>

Oh, I'm captivated.

You'd do her a favor.

She hears what she wants to hear, okay?

Yeah?  What happened?

What happened?

See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.

Why?

Makes two of us.

Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.

I only owe you a ride, Vincent.

That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...

Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?

What happened to you?

Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?

None of your business.

Slow down.

What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.

Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.

Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.

I can't promise you anything.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?

For what?

Don't tell me you're naked back there.

Do they have a secret handshake?

I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.

Flesh wound.  No big deal.

Can you prove any of this?

Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?

Just a guy trying to put out a fire.

Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.

It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.

What van?

I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.

Realized what?

So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.

Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?

A water main broke.

If that's what you want.  Yes.

I like you, Jerry.  A lot.

Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.

No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?

This way.

You go.  Send me a postcard.

He gave it to me.

Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.

I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.

Now she tells me.

You've never seen her run.

Then I can't be hurt anymore.

Well, I don't know if --

I don't know...

Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.

It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?

You've asked me that one three times.

Excuse me?

We're very specialized.

Yes, that's right.

I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.

I don't understand.

Working.

Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'

What do I look like to you? Switzerland?

Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?

This doesn't make sense.

It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?

You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.

I don't think so.

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --

How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --

Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --

What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.

No, thanks.

Goddamnit, they are out there, David --

David --

With me.

I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.

Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?

Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.

This... seemed best.

Good luck, David.

What would you have me say, David?

It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...

How soon will you be able to decode it?

Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...

In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.

We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.

I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.

Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.

Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.

It's a civilian facility.

It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.

You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !

Is that your official response?

Big enough radio, I don't see why not.

I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.

The librarian... or the library...?

I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.

I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.

It's so... small.

Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?

And?

Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.

Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.

Actually --

That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.

You too.

Wait -- hold on a minute --

That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --

That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.

Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.

If you came back.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry -- I can't --

It was quite a page turner.

I'm not sure it's come to that.

Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!

Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?

Meaning...

Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --

I got two years.

We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?

What are you doin' here?

Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.

Gotta go, Arletta.

Ram it in and break it off!

Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --

I know, I know. Just don't hit me.

Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.

I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --

Borrowin'.

I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.

Get away!

Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.

I didn't say nothin', Boss.

I just always did like truck rides.

Fifty's a nice round number.

Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.

We got it locked in the sock.

Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.

On my own.

He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.

Forty-five.

Gettin' up, Carr.

Call.

Well, how far didya get?

A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?

Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.

Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.

Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?

You talked to me.  Do you remember?

Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?

Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...

You get me out first.

What Friday?

I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...

He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.

She don't want it.

You come and visit.

Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?

I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.

That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...

I think this is number three...

Is he out?

If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.

Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?

Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?

You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...

I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...

That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.

Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.

One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...

He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.

What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?

Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.

W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...

They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...

No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

I know, baby.  I know.

He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...

You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.

Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.

I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?

It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.

Classy madonna.

Honest to God, Ruben!

Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...

Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...

Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...

I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.

The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.

That's always your privilege, sir.

What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"

You're damn right I do.

Helen Hudson...

I gotta have Ruben, and a...

"Spokes<u>person</u>."

What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?

Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

And her husband? What was he?

It is?

Are we imagining it?

We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.

That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.

When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.

I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.

Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.

I live in my car. This is my workshop.

You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.

I did this already.

What?

I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...

I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.

We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?

Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.

All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.

I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.

Truly.

Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?

I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.

Oh, no, of course not.

You don't have to make any decisions tonight.

I know.    I know.

I'll be running it three days a week, and...

Come on.

Wow.   Congratulations.

Especially with a promotion in the offing.

Can I get you a glass of champagne?

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

But what about Beast?   Who'll...?

I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.

Don't be fresh.

It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.

Terrific.

By color.

It's magic.

Enough with the abracadabra.

Good God.

I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.

Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.

Break up?    They wish.

I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?

How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?

Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?

I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.

I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.

I like it.     But Headlines are better.

I'll be forced to tickle you.

Sounds grim.

You don't have to take care of me, you know.

Coming.

Always the drugs.

I saw you talking to my Mom.

I think I should call someone.

I guess so.

Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.

What do you want to do?

That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.

Oh, ok.   Maybe.

Sure. Of course.

You can get out of the dinner.

I'm going to the store.

That's a big question.

No.

He's a patient here.

I love him.

I start on Monday.

I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.

I'm glad you're doing well.

Do you know who this is?

You killed her!

Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.

Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.

Not today.   Where are your friends?

Where did they go?

What?   This?

You're there now?

You're calling me on your cell phone, right?

My number's going to show up on his bill!

What?

-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.

To tell you that we're interested in the property.

And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.

Supernumerary. It means better than expected.

You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.

He missed three weeks.

You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.

I guess we're going to find out.

I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.

You want me to help you get out of the country?

Half the tapes.

I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.

Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.

You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.

We can't.

We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

Cops?

And the Vodka.

I can't believe you didn't check.

It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.

Maybe if we gave the tapes back --

Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.

Good idea.

That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.

I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.

He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

You haven't answered my question.

I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.

I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?

Fine.     Ten o'clock.

Hard to say.

Boy, you must be pissed.

Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.

No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?

A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.

I was told to take what we have and go.

Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?

I see.   A master criminal.

What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?

Okay.    I will have a beer.

C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.

Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.

She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.

This is the only American car you've ever driven.

I'm not going to leave you.

How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?

What are we going to do, take a taxi?

Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

It's my idea.



Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

The hell it is.

Fuck me?   Fuck you!

Uh huh.

The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.

I know where she went.

What?

I don't know.

Take a nap.

Something like that.

It's okay.   It was a long time ago.

It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.

Stick around and find out.

She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.

Wait!  I'm a friend!

I do as I please.

Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.

I'll never live as a thief!

Long.

Don't bother.

I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?

You're too young to understand.

Really?

Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.

So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?

How so?

Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.

Kneel!

It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.

Give me back my comb.

You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

I will.

"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."

I left the training early.

During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.

Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?

Perhaps.

You always suspected she'd fled to the West.

Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.

That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.

Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?

My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.

That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.

A murderer?

We must avenge mother!

What does it say?

Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.

Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.

When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!

This is a delicate matter.

What do you have in mind?

Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.

Annie, I need a file.

I knew that.

You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.

Fucking A, my friend.

I saw it, too.

I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?

Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.

I told you you're not supposed to come in here.

She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.

I think he's yours, now.

And she'll be alive.  Up here.

Mom tried to cook.

I don't know you.

Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.

Victims.  Aren't we all.

Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.

T-Bird?

I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.

Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.

Does it hurt?

Shelly?

Yes.

Go away.

I'm already alone.

This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.

Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.

I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.

Is he inside?

No shooting.

Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.

Annette Harrison.

Really? I thought he said it all the time.

On my mother's life.

No.

I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.

Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?

It's not really important.

What'cha reading?

Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.

That's a matter of opinion.

Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.

Please.

You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?

Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.

Refreshing.

It's my house.

No thank you.

I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.

Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.

It's not about being happy. You and I can't -

How was your date?

What are you doing?

Of Human Bondage.

I can't win with you.

I am lighten. Can we drop this?

No.

Where are you going?

I think that's for the best.

Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.

Hi.

Yeah, me neither.

I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.

What, your virginity? Well that's over now.

I'm sorry about that.

Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.

Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.

What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.

Do you want to learn or not?

It was nothing.

Okay.

Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.

Why?

It's Kathryn.

I... I don't think you want to know.

That's one way of looking at it.

Of course. I'm not a monster.

I swear.

Same time next week?

Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?

Get out of here.

Did you do everything I asked you to?

I told you I don't know.

Racist piece of shit.

Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

Sounds intriguing.

Shut up and turn to page 64.

It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.

Shhh.

You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.

Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

I hate it too.

Well, let me know when you do. Until then.

Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?

What's your problem?

Morning.

Where'd she go?

Kind of.

Oh yes.

I've never done this before.

I have a flair for drama.

I accept. Now get out.

That's beautiful.

Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.

Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...

Annette! Annette!

I did?

Nope.

I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.

You're a lucky guy.

It seems that you and I have some talking to do.

You bastard!

Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.

What do you mean?

I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself  tell the truth --

The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.

Sometimes.

That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!

At the old house with the voice.

I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.

What's her name?

Irena.

Times have changed.

No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.

But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?

I'm never unfair.

I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!

Well, you know where it is.

Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.

I suppose so.

Yes, daddy.

Yes, I did.

I'll show you.

I didn't forget.

Daddy, it's true.

But...

No.

Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.

I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.

For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me

No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.

I'll just never learn arithmetic.

Yes, yes! I see Prince,

This is more fun than just pretend.

But we don't have any sea weed.

It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.

Yes, Amy.

Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.

Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.

I'm trying to.

Will you come soon?

I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.

But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.

If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.

The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.

Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?

Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"

Yes, yes -

My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.

Anybody could know that song.

I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.

That's from her -- that woman.

Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.

I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.

She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.

What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.

James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...

Yeah but they looked cool...

Your lips look delicious.

Never felt better.

I get crazy dreams and I black out.

No it's mom.

Anything's better than Mark.

So don't look in his eyes.

You're just saying that.

No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.

Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.

To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.

You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...

I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.

Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!

I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!

You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.

I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.

Tell them you'll meet them outside.

Hide him.

Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.

You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.

I guess you'll find out.

Did I kill a guy named Benito?

Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.

Sure. See ya.

Hey, how about a little nightcap?

Yes I do have to pee!

You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!

Take your shower.

Did you change your hair?

No?

That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.

No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.

So what book did you buy?

Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?

NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.

Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.

It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.

No, but thanks for the warning.

This is a lot worse than "Betty."

No, my bite's a lot worse.

Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.

No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?

Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?

You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?

Worse than this?

What about... those guys... I might have...

Okay.

Thanks.

You got a dog?

How big?

Packages of money.

Tell her I'm eating.

It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.

We're just trying to figure out what happened.

Why would you want to be a cop?

Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?

I told you she was innocent.

She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.

Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.

And he was missing an arm.

Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.

She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.

Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.

Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.

I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...

What makes her think that?

Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?

How will we interrogate them?

He tried to kill me!

I don't know what you're talking about.

I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.

You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.

How could you have been so stupid?

Sorry, sir.

Patricia Crenshaw.

Good.

Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?

Shut-up.

I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.

Why are they after you?

Don't know much, do you?

It sure isn't the fun-fair.

This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?

Yes.

It must be a closet or something.

Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.

But I...

Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?

You're supposed to be my doctor, right?

You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.

No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...

Nothing.  I don't know anything!

I'm...  being...  punished.

`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...

What?

What the hell is this ?

Great.

The guy's in a coma, Bob.

Like how?

Mild stroke?

It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.

I just hope this yutz can pull it off.

We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.

I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!

He's only doing what you told him to.

Just what you think I mean.

It's fine.

I'm not sure.

Choices?

You could buy it on payments.

I'm not sure... I might have.

Well... I gues I would... Yeah.

I see what you mean.

A teleprompter.

Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...

But we went there.  We saw those kids.

Does it make the cars any better?

Why?

Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?

Certainly.

All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.

Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.

No.

We'd like to hire you.

What about it?

I had a feeling.

The Vice-President...

Well...

Uh...

Go tuck yourself, Bill.

Anybody would have done it.

I don't know.

Home.

Oh... Okay.

He wasn't always like that, anyway.

You have a lot of secrets.

I know.

Yeah... Bedtime.

Yeah, well... It's finally over.

I know.

All set.

NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!

Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 

I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.

Quiet!

I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.

SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!

I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...

Gasparilla?

That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.

He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.

The hospital? 

We got a boat.

We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.

Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.

I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.

You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!

Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.

In the battle, sir.

I'm alright. Let's go.

Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?

Knox?

Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.

Well?

Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!

Garden?

So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.

Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?

I told you, that's a secret.

But...

what?!

Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.

Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!

My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.

Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.

Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.

Chet, you don't have to hurt him.

Sort of.

Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.

Huh?

Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?

You say that over and over but you don't even know me!

Just like that?!  You just knew?

And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?

That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.

Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:

I didn't know you taught.

A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.

Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!

Isn't there an easier way?

Yeah.

What I have to do.  Screw the annual.

I'm calling her!

Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?

Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.

But different.

Thanks but  I'd better do history.

Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.

You want me out...  is that what you're saying?

Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.

They gave me the exact same thing as last year!

Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.

what?

YEA, ART THOU THERE?!

All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.

20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.

I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.

Did you clear this?

That's where my boat's moored.

The thieves.

What are you people talking about?

Jesus Christ lady...

Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...

Well, you sure do a good imitation.

Anti social?

How do you know that?

What?

Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.

No...

He's not coming...

You ain't giving the orders here!

I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...

Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...

Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?

A passenger...

You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?

Nothing.

John...

Yeah.

Good... Pass the beer.

What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?

Yeah, Sal--

You're full of shit!

Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

It's Nick!

I know, but...

Vince thinks... you know...

In case!!! The gun's in case!!!

She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!

Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...

Yeah.

Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.

But you must come in.

But I insist.

You are frightened, no?

I came to see Merle.

Yeah.

Linda, yeah.

Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!

Who's got the ammo?

Inside, Vince.

She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.

Biederman!

Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.

Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.

Naw, it's... I mean...

Right here.

I don't know.

No. No, no.

I want to go home, Merle.

There's Vince!

Hell no!

Merle --

What else?

What do you mean?

More bullets in the gun?

Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?

Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?

As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.

Right.

John Wayne... Listen, Nick --

I gotta get back, Nick.

Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.

Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --

Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.

Aw, it's a long story!

Down.

Up.

I can smell it.

He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.

It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.

When you bring in Doucet.

Out of the room.

You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!

We have to talk.

You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.

It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.

NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.

Fine.

How do I look?

Keep 'em busy.

Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.

Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---

But Sergeant...

Trust me.  You don't want to know.

'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.

Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.

Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.

Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.

Yes, sir.

With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.

We're partners, aren't we?

That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.

Aaah... Mother of Jesus.

He's got my grandson, Sanchez.

And you should be with your family.

This is the guy that killed my partner.

They always are.

Yeah.

My mom says I'm gonna grow.

Good to know you, Willy.

I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.

We will --

They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --

They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.

I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --

I didn't.

Guess there will, if it says so.

A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?

And what about Daniel Webster?

Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.

No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.

I did not, Grandma.

Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?

Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...

Sure am.

Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--

Well, Stone -- have you got the money?

What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?

Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--

Don't say that -- I know it is --

What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?

I do -- and I think you should too.

You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.

Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.

Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--

A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?

You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --

He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.

I'm through with you.

Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.

Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!

About what?

But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?

Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Morning, Jabez.

Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.

You mean that's all you had me come out here for?

Well -- yes --

You are not so sure that he'll come.

It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.

You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --

Jabez!

But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --

I am going to lock him up.

It shows on your face.

Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?

I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.

That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...

All right, son -- if it helps.

Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?

Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.

Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?

I say -- it don't matter.

You'll be a father any minute now.

Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.

Mary -- Jabez --

Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?

Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.

Of course not --

Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.

Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.

Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.

I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.

Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...

The past six months.

So, why didn't you come?

You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?

Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.

We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!

Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!

Who are you, then?

I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?

Gennero.  Miss Gennero.

Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?

Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?

I'm ahead of you...partner.

Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --

I'm here, cowboy.

Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.

You don't want to know.

How do you know?

-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!

Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!

You men shoot, aim for the white meat!

Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!

Don't call yourself fat.

Heidi - why didn't you come down here?

It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...

Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.

The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?

I love you.

Yeah, well I don't blame him.

That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.

I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.

I like that... yeah!

What?

All right.  Then what do you want me to say?

That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?

All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?

All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?

Do you still want the operation?

Oh no!

What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.

He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.

What are you doin' in there?

This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...

They're okay.

I'm not alone.

What do you want to know that for?

Right -- I'm with you, buddy.

It's okay, you got a lot of protection.

I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.

Sonny, come on out!

Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...

We're bringing in your wife...

He's all doped up.

Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?

It's all we got.

Believe me, I'm on your side.

It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.

They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.

If you take anybody, please take me.

I don't know.

They look like good kids.

I told you, he's got diabetes.

You were terrific, too!

No, not until after they killed him.

Yeah.

You stopped?  Why?

Fuck him - let him out!

I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.

Dead or alive?

All right ... send them the guard.



... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!

They gotta stop sayin' that.

I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.

Okay, when do I get them?

I want them all.

Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...

Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...

Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.

What'll you do?  Come out.

Doing what?

I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?

Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?

<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>

<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>

<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>

<i>I forgot.</i>

Did it hurt?

Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.

<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>

Show me the tapes. I want to see them.

Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>

I said stop it.

I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.

Hello?

You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?

No. What's the big deal?

He said... take his right arm.

Fucking Map Quest. <i>Never again.</i> <b> EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT </b> Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER on the front of the RV.

And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.

Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.

But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.

She went up to her room.

Real good.

I be.  I'm living large.

We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.

If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.

Have you noticed something about them?

And?

What?

No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.

I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 

Is it a good morning?

I didn't.

That's it?

You got a deal.

It's gonna be hot today.

Later.  Gotta get paid.

I just come home to take a quick shower.

I'm coming.

Stop tripping.

Don't worry about it.

Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.

Him no white.  Him no white.

Depends.

Here, you gotta delivery.

Sal, I want my money.

You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.

OK.  OK.

That's it?

What took you so long?  Is it hot?

Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?

I can run out and get it.

Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.

Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?

Tina, I'll be right back.

Later.

Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.

Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.

People are free to do what they wanna do.

What?

Ya like him, huh?

I was going to buy a slice.

I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.

He's nuts.

Forget it, Mookie.

Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.

I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.

I like Mookie a lot.

Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.

Too many pizzerias already there.

Don't start on me today.

Actually we have something for you.

Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.

Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?

I'm fine.

Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.

I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?

Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!

No, I'm fine thanks.

I know I am, Mom.

Is it okay if he spends the night?

Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!

Don't we want them to talk to us?

How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.

Oh, is this your special place?

The second R is silent.

HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.

Now that's more of what we're looking for.

Who's Captain Rob?

Sounds like a pirate.

Yeah, he's a pirate.

A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!

Shut up!

Now you see why he was elected principal?

That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.

What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.

Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.

What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?

Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?

Do you hear something, Captain Rob?

Me, me, me!

No. What happened?

No. Look.

You thinking what I'm thinking?

How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.

It was a diamond and you swallowed it.

Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.

Hey, where'd you go?

That's gross.

Not to expect you tonight.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Special Needs class.

Do you want me to pet your head?

Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.

Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.

Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?

Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.

Duh. I'm in your class at school.

I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...

Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.

You can bring whatever you want, little friend.

Go in there and get us two slushees.

Hey can be on top?

You know I do!

It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...

We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!

People! Come on. "Parade" float.

You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.

No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.

Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.

How baby-cakes? You've done it all.

Aloha means hello and goodbye.

I think you'll make a good teacher.

Who's there?

Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.

Everything. Just for the record.

The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.

Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.

We are alone...

Yes?... How was your journey?

It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.

Is this what you seek?

They said you were dead.  They said...

I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.

It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.

Your Reverence.

You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...

 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...

Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.

No.

Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.

Long live the fighters!

Pain.

SILENCE... SILENCE.

They tried and died....  Jessica!

I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.

Huh?

I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.

Do you want me to get it for you?

Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.

Ah, so I pull the strings!

Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --

That's good.  I could use the money.

"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."

That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."

This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.

You'll be fighting with the octopus.

Once you're in it, it warms up.

Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.

Formaldehyde.

Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!

Really?  I don't feel so great.

No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.

Eddie, how was I?

Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?

What do you mean?

No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.

This is the big moment...!

And who may you be?

It's that easy?

I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.

Isn't he?

Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.

Better than not getting a job?

Boris Karloff!?

This is my way of telling you --

Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.

That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!

Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.

Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!

Like <u>what</u>?!

That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?

Does she have room for me?

Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.

What other sixty-thousand?

That's not true --

I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.

Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.

Da pleasure be mine.

Really?  Was the third act too intense?

Okey-dokey.

Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.

Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.

It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...

Tits.

Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!

Who?

There's still a sex-change --

I don't think he's a schmuck.

I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.

Maybe it needs special handling.

Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.

I am.  How's your father?

Not good...

Bela died.

Well you tried --

So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.

Yes?

You don't wanna be noticed?

What's uncanny?

Yeah...?

What octopus motor?

So how long have you known Eddie?

Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?

It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.

You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?

Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.

Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.

Come on...

I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.

You're nuts.

Excuse me.

And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.

Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?

You said a woman likes to be pursued.

No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.

This guy.

I'm not sure about the entire concept.

I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.

Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?

Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...

Tell me.

I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.

Do you want us to come in the kitchen?

Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.

I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...

Mm.

So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.

Yes to me or yes to the coil?

Holy sh--

He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.

Oh God. What hospital?

Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!

No.

All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!

Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?

I hear the dog really liked him.

I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?

It's... okay

All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.

Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.

Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.

No. Who?

Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 

Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?

Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.

No... Could you?

Where were you?

What are you drunk?

You're in show business?

In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --

All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?

I don't know.

Yeah?!

Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.

No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.

It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...

Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.

Cassie...

Me?!

A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.

Who's Shari?

Hi.

No. Am I supposed to?

So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."

Ed... I'm sorry.

Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.

Sure.

That's the point -- this could change things.

Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.

pierdes.

Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.

That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.

Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.

Thank you.

Yeah, uh, just a minute

Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.

Dick... Dick,..

Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --

So nice

But, they were there I counted 803 votes.

You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.

Right

Aren't you supposed to keep them?

I thought you were supposed to keep them.

So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.

Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.

Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?

I'm looking at new cars.

Yeah.

Yes?

Doing what?

Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?

I did it.

I have proof.

Okay.  Give me the drill.

Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.

Should we get a what?

Oh.

Three twenty-five.

Sherry... I love you.

No way I It doesn't make sense.

I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?

I know.

Sorry.

What do you mean?

No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --

Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.

You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.

Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*

Paul, get out!

What's it to you?

Yeah, plain scotch.

No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?

That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.

Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

Yeah.

I'm not sure.

Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.

It's Bud.

You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?

This business, Captain?

Call me Dudley.

Of course... But how?

Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?

What was that boyfriend's name?

It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?

Get the fuck away from me.

They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.

There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.

Which one are you and which one am I?

At least not anymore.

We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.

I'm not asking you.

You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?

He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.

I got her address.

And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?

His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.

Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.

He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?

<u>Ear plugs</u>.

It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.

The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.

Say what and so what.

I don't own no shotguns.

I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.

Gone.  Not a trace.

I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.

I'll break them, sir.

Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.

<u>Throwing me</u>?

What about you?

I want you to follow Bud White.

What?

Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.

What?

A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.

With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.

Of his penis, sir?

I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.

You want to know what Bud's like in bed?

I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.

I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.

I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.

Some reality.

You're the first person to ever call me tough.

Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?

Officer White?

I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.

You lost me, Sid.  Who?

I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.

You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.

Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.

Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.

You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.

Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?

Oh?  Anyplace else?

Oh Jesus.

I don't know what that means.

Listen--

Turn on CNN.

Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!

Do it!

Be careful, Danny.

Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.

Rachel Banks?

I don't know who he is.

Told by whom?

Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.

230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.

If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.

They're spooks.

One-twenty.

I didn't use my name.

How'd you have the manpower to--

Jesus.

They come after you?

Why?

Oh my God...

That wasn't so hard.

Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

Tell me about it.

No he won't.

So what do we do now?

What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.

The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.

Listen--

Are you sure about this?

Neil, thank you for your help.

Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--

I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...

Is that good?

Okay.

The robbery.

I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.

What kind of trouble.

I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.

No, sir.

Listen to him.

Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.

Well, you know--

There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.

I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.

Stacy--

Was that doctored-up, too?

I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--

This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.

What happened to your head?

That's okay.

You opened the thing?

Albert's gonna get me my job back.

Sir?

Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.

That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--

I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.

I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.

Not that much.

I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.

He doesn't work that way.

The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.

You don't work there anymore, Bobby.

What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?

We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--

Shut the fuck up.

Seat 74.

L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.

Are those my Christmas presents?

Alright!

Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?

Table 122?

An investigation? It was a bus accident.

Bobby--

Why would the NSA--

Listen to me.

No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.

No. No, it's okay.

How can I reach you?

I don't know.

Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.

Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.

You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.

I said fuck you.

There was a transfer.

Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?

Get it.

Sir--

We believe?

You're kidding me.

And if it wasn't?

Puffed cheese?

No.

What kind of fossils?

I don't want to go back.

I don't care to bargain.

As the wife of one of our party.

He said - be careful.

Pardon?

Now.

Now.

A lie.  What do you hate most?

This is empty, just coming!

I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.

Don't go over it again, please.

Would you let me pass?

I can't move.  I can't get out.

I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.

Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.

I know.

I haven't, no.  Sorry.

Could I trouble you for some water?

Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.

Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.

Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.

Right.

I told you so.

Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.

Shut-up!

That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?

I don't know.

Don't cut me.  Come on.

I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.

You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.

Please don't creep around this house.

For?

Is there a song you don't know?

Me?

I see.

Oh really?

Aren't you?

I can already see.

No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.

Yes?

Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -

He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.

K is for Katharine.

Hey! -

Never heard of it.

Yes, for your hair.

I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.

I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.

I should go to the house, get breakfast.

I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.

Hello miss.

He's sleeping.

Does he have to go?

Go away.

This is making me incredibly angry.

- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.

Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.

Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.

Why?  Are you German?

Through a window.

Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.

You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.

Who am I?

It's sold.

How about if you try disappearing.

You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.

Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...

Uh, yes.

I'll call an ambulance.

I sincerely hope so.

So what?

You...you can't.

No. Why would I be?

The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.

So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.

Good morning.

As I recall, you've robbed it before.

In a week.

We go underwater?

Try laps. Say a hundred.

A dozen times.

It's---beautiful.

Terrified. Still am.

Bookshelf. Sensors--

In eye of that painting.

It's a party.

No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.

It's your mistake.

Get the hell in.

Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?

Okay, 80-20--

My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--

Hold the record. Alone.

There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.

You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.

My job, my rules.

You're being useless. I'm making us rich.

Transfer.

We're doing it tonight.

There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.

What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?

Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.

I'm not leaving without you.

But--

Next time I'll use valet parking.

Which is--

Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.

This is big enough.

It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.

You're impressed with her, aren't you?

She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.

It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?

You're giving them to me?

We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...

Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.

Hey, excellent.  Thanks.

Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.

Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.

I'll say.  Holy moley.

Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.

They did?

The what?

Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.

It was right up on the PG&E property over there.

Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?

For what?

Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.

A number for the whole group, or for us?

Any school you want.

Yup.

Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

Where's Anna?

Excuse me?

I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --

I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.

Course I did.

Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.

So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

That's crazy -- why not?

Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?

Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.

They skipped that step.

PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.

It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.

How do you know that?

Corey.

Right.

And ...?

That's right.

What do you mean?

I guess I did.

I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?

Nope.  Maiden.

Not anymore.

Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...

I don't know.

Some meeting.  With PG&E people.

You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.

Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.

You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.

Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.

What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?

You got more than one?

Why not?

I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.

Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.

Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.

Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

What do you mean?

No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.

No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.

How would you know?

Keep your voice down.

Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?

I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.

I need it.

Mm-hm.

Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.

Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.

Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.

Yes?

Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?

No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.

Right, I guess those are the kids --

You did?

Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?

Yes, Admiral .... soon.

Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!

But Han and Leia will surely die.

Barks an argument and shakes his head.

I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.

Barks his right on!

Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.

Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!

A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.

Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.

Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!

There is a grave disturbance in The Force.

You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.

Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?

I'm going to see what it is.

No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.

This baby's got a few surprises left in her.

Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.

How do I look?

Well, I hope you don't expect more.

They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.

Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.

Where?

There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.

Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.

The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.

Can you trust him?

Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.

Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.

Hyperdrive.

Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?

You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.

I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.

... we're the bait.

I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.

I didn't say anything?

It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.

Are the coordinates set?

Closer?!

I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.

Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?

I thought those seekers were set for stun!

Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.

It is the future you see.

Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.

I'll die first.

Anything on the Millennium Falcon?

Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.

It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.

You never heard of Snake Plissken?

Go on now. Do as I say.

Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?

We'll see.

You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.

Can you land?

My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?

What's the little black box do?

Having second thoughts?

There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?

A medical team will be standing by.

No.

Nuclear turbine to 75% power.

It's history. I gotta go.

You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.

I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.

Delgado?

Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.

I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...

I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.

Which way?

Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?

Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?

Where's... Cuervo Jones...?

Where?

Who?

The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.

I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.

The what?

Find Cuervo Jones.

Thank God.

I will not.

Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.

We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...

It is deep...

That's not why you came.

The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!

Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.

I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?

My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.

You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...

It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.

Not you, my husband?

If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.

Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.

I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.

He has given up.

Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?

Can it truly be used for magic?

No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...

People make you laugh?

Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...

What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.

I am the desert, where water disappears--

One land, one king! That is my peace!

Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.

I?

To kill and be king, is that all?

Well what's wrong?

What's he doing there? Teaching?

Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?

I didn't know that.

Yes.

Thank you your excellency.

What's this?

No. Not at all,

Not that I know of.

Want to ask him?

Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.

When she's well enough, I'll ask.

I just heard them Karl.

Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.

No thanks Karl.

Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.

Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!

Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?

Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.

She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.

Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.

What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?

Sure did.

He didn't mention her.

The priest.

Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.

Could you see her?

Nothing you could do would make it any worse.

What else?

Yes I did, I'm sorry.

Not at all. Why d'you ask?

Are you sure?

No.

Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.

You like it?

I found it.

I wouldn't talk.

You like him.

Do you not like him like daddy?

Why does God let us get tired?

St. Mike's.

College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.

Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.

No.

And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!

That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.

You and us.

Uh Huh.

Who are you?

Uoy era ohw.

I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.

Why?

Who places her trust in thee, my God.

Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.

And also with you.

Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?

I've seen him.

From the psychiatric end.

Sick priest, is that it?

No I probably wouldn't.

Alright. You know who I think really did it?

The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

Are you tired?

Shove it up your ass you faggot!

Do you have an appointment?

Are you a relative?

Twelve.

Sometimes.

I don't know.

You're not going to drive!

You wanted to see me, Charlie?

Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.

Teeth.

The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.

No.

Recognize these two characters?

How we doing?

You look like you just crawled out of bed.

Fuck him.

Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.

Bosen black.  Flat.

Why the interest?

What about that waitress at the Ambassador?

No thanks.

No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.

Says who?

What do you mean?

It's me.

What?

I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.

It wasn't like that.

No.

I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.

It never was.

Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.

Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.

She's here.

You wanna get a drink?

Two years ago.  March.

Last?

A few bars!

Okay.

Doesn't it matter to you?

I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.

It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.

What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.

She's a big girl.

Huh?

A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.

Yeah.

The tenth's out.

I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.

No.

A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?

We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!

Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.

I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?

Spur of the moment.

Yes, it is.

My watch is broken, too.

Don't take it personally.

Uh ... we'll let you know.

Where's my name?

Hey!

Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?

You can buy new ones tomorrow.

Piece of cake.

I was gonna split it with you guys.

The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.

Hey.

For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.

Virgins.

He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.

I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.

Smells like fish.

Smells like tuna number two to me.

Great.

Uh, well ...

Thanks, Lloyd.

I'll call you.

Job.

Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.

You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.

Frank works hard.

He'll come around.

His kid's sick.

In and out.

Like a baby. You?

Hey, business is business.

Nothing.

I'm not upset.

Let's make a deal.  You shut up.

Who's Nina?

Ed? How many people live here?

Soap?

No kidding?

Coffee?

You don't pick your brother.

Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.

Another five years, huh?

Sounds big.  What's he do?

What are they?

What's a prom?

He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.

Fine.  You?

Eddie.

They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.

Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."

What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?

My place.

Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.

You're not holding him right ... Caz ...

So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?

Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.

It's important.

Something good?

Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...

-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.

What more proof do you need?

Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.

No life signs at all. He's a turnip.

Would it?

The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.

You said it, Jon, not me.

Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.

Trust me, he's already here. Get going!

I won't tell mom if you don't.

Like you know anything about it.

What?

Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.

Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.

Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...

A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...

D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.

It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?

Don't I usually kiss my wife?

Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?

Gone?

I'm not going anywhere.

Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --

The world can wait, Jon. You're going.

Great.

Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.

Back then -- who wasn't?

Yeah Jack, her assistant...

I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?

Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...

Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.

I dont think youre hearing me.

Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?

Got it.  Good tip.

Great room...

Its just two kids, right?

Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!

Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...

She wants to have an affair with me.

Hey, is that really necessary?

The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!

I call all you white guys "Jack."

There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.

Hey...

Thats my car!  You stole my car!

Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.

You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...

I dont think so, thank you...

Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?

Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?

No, I didnt...thats great.

Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...

Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.

Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...

But its twenty degrees outside...

And...?

I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.

Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.

No, Im serious...youre really stunning...

I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...

Do what?

Really.

I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!

You had a heart attack?

Its wonderful...

What are you sure about?

I dont think Id fight you on that one...

Think bigger.

Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...

No, Jack, I never got married. You?

Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...

A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!

That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...

But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...

Thats easy. Youve seen my car.

So we'll get egg nog.

Merry Christmas...

Yes!

I wouldn't know anything about that.

Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --

I'm sure he's matured since then.

Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.

Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?

I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.

Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

I already got it.  Everything I want.

To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.

And you can?  Power it up?

Ben!  Ben!

You've been working out.

Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?

I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --

Last one down springs for room service.

<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.

Okay, "mom."

Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?

<u>Girl</u>...?!

Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.

Showtime.

Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.

Hilarious.

He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.

Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.

It's been changed.

Great minds think alike.

Passion.

We need to get past them.

What...?  <u>Oh</u>.

Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

I'm sure I can come up with something.

Are you kidding?

No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.

Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --

Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --

Susan.  What are you doing?

We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?

Phase Two.

The less time, the better.

In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.

Message to Proteus.

It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!

The Other Side got to him.

What can I do? Except maybe pass out?

And take a little trip with them...

Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.

Yes...slowed down agreat deal.

It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.

Yes, Cora.

No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.

I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.

Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --

I always thought it was nothing but red.

As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?

Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.

Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!

Yes...

Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --

You left something out.

Oxygenation...

Then why not take it?

Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --

How are you, Miss Peterson?

It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.

If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?

Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.

They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.

Send the following message...

His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.

You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...

Two in a row?

Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.

I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?

It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.

Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.

Enough to breathe, but that's all.

Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.

Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...

Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!

What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --

On the Repeater.

Looks simple to operate.

I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.

Was there any damage?

I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.

I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!

Unghh... oh, geez...

I don't know. Few munce.

Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

Yeah, you already said that.

I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -

Oh, geez.

The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?

This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -

Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -

Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.

Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.

This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.

Oh, yah, I know that!

Well, okay - thank you, Detective.

Pretty darn good, ya want some?

Uhn.

Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -

...Babe the Blue Ox?

Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?

This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.

My patience is at an end.

We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.

Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?

No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?

No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -

...There's a million dollars here!

Yah?

You had breakfast yet, Margie?

Yah...

Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?

Yah.

No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.

Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.

Just a Diet Coke.

Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!

Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?

Yah, is this Marge?

Margie Olmstead?

What'd he say?

His wife?

No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.

Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.

Love ya, Margie.

Yah?

Yah.

I love you, Norm.

We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.

She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.

His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.

Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...

Congratulations, Jerry.

He's at Norstar.

Well -

Well... Why don't we...

I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.

Some of it, yes.

Yes?

This is... really a shock...

Can't you give me something?

Sure.

What?

Practicing what?

Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.

You can't have the whole brain!

Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.

The girl had done her homework.

What... ?

It suits you.

Goodbye.

Here.

Feel anything?

Can I come in?

What?

Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"

We did make love?

What... ?

Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.

Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.

I'm sorry, but I...

You fucking slut!!

... You know me?

Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...

I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.

Pardon me?

Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.

This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.

So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?

You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.

I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.

I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?

Where do you want it?  In the face?

Like hell.  That counted.

Call what off?

After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."

A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.

What car?

Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.

He was obviously able to handle it.

Yes, I promise.

"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."

No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.

Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.

Imagine how he feels.

You know what I mean.

What are you doing?!

Nothing.

If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.

Why do people think I'm you?

Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

Answer me, Tyler.

What are you talking about... ?

And, sometimes you control it...

But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...

I'm not going...

Stop finishing...

Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?

If you know, I know.

I think this is about where we came in.

i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....

Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 

Why what?

I swear on my life, I won't...

You told me you'd say that.

What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...

No, please, no, God, no!

I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.

Signs?

You were there?

Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?

What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?

I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.

Speed up.

I have to save Eugene!

Taken care of.

Random, sure.

Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.

That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.

Carter.

What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?

Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?

Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.

Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.

Evan Shaeffer's dead.

We have to tell her she's in danger!

Who is this guy, anyway?

Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.

Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.

How does a nice mature fuck sound?

Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.

I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.

You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?

Hey, Dad.  What's up?

Who am I, David Blane?

Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.

I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.

Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?

Easy, Billy, just open it.

Get out! Get out of the car!

I wish you were on the plane!

I don't.

Look, there's something you should all know.

Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?

Oh, you've noticed it, too?

Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...

'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!

No one's that strong.

May as well go out under my own free will, right?

That's right, buddy.

Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...

This is state-of-the-art firepower.

Where's your stuff?

There are no worse places.

Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?

Alright.  Home run.

Bastards.  Let's get some shots.

I suppose you have...

You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.

I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.

They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.

Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.

Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.

Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.

How?

Let's get that tent down!

Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.

I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.

Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.

Not yet.

We just take pictures?

I was crossed-trained in gunships.

That's right.

Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.

About 22 hours on site.

The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!

It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.

That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.

Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.

That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?

This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.

Two kids tried to set me on fire.

You still believe in God?

What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!

Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.

And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....

Thank you very much.

I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.

"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?

Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?

First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?

I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.

Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!

He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...

Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...

She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...

Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?

Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.

NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!

It was a crime.

You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.

Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?

Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...

Lydia.  Lydia what?

"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!

I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!

Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...

They're --  -- What?

I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...

I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.

Parry... I'm Jack.

Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.

Funny -- you look married.

Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...

Fifty dollars?

Well what am I gonna do with it?

Who?

Bingo!

Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...

Sure...

What are the other reasons?

I know!

<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>

Got any Ethel Merman?

What a gyp.

Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...

No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.

And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..

Divorced.

Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.

I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...

No, dammit, I would easy.

Will you just do what the hell I tell you...

I hope they do.

You treat me like I was.

You're goin' a find me dead one time.

Okay...

Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...

Fill it up.

Who?

It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...

Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?

I didn't get it, did I?

I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.

Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.

Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.

Don't, then.

Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.

Oh, well, what, what's he...

I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...

What?

Yeah, well, he's...

My turn.

I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.

What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.

Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.

I don't know. Let me give it some thought.

Is he?

I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.

What?

Thanks, Carl...

That's what I mean...

No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...

Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...

That's an old maid's tale.

I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.

Well, she was.

Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.

There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.

Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.

I'm wit' Carlos.

Hi.

Um. Yeah! Shorty!

You look good.

Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.

I can't man, I'm punished!

C'mon.

Eddie from Compost?

No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?

She lives near Eddie?

How old is he?

Yeah.

Positive.

I'm a good friend of hers.

Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.

Nah.

Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.

He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?

You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?

I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.

Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.

Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.

Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?

Thank God, the police.

We play tennis at the club.

He was in intensive care for eight weeks.

No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?

I'm serious, Sam.

Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.

I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.

She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.

My lawyer was a bum.

You may be right.

That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.

This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.

Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.

I'd have been long gone.

How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.

Whoops.

Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?

Where are you going?

Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.

Fletch, I never sold nothing.

I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.

Yeah. Maybe.

Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?

Charmed.

Come inside.

I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?

Sure, all drifters do.

Take it where?

Sure.

I wonder if that's his doctor.

You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.

Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.

Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.

I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.

It's Scotch-Rumanian.

So were my parents.

I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?

Yes.

It's amazing.

Just like Alan. It's freaky.

Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?

I checked. There was no divorce.

Yes, I'm with the Underhills.

I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.

Who are you?

She moved out.

And a damn fine one, I might add.

Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!

I don't know.  Look!

Who? Donnie and Marie?

You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.

Of course.

Who's your decorator?

Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?

What did these Vancouver factories do?

I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...

Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.

Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?

Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!

Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.

Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.

I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?

No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.

Make eye contact when you say that.

Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...

Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.

Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.

Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.

What?

Peachy.

I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!

Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...

Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.

Ye-ah.  Sure.

Ye-ah.

But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.

ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.

Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.

Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

Did he just say what I think he said?

You need it.

And hey, I appreciate it...

Who's my real father, man?

Shut the heck up... Pop.

I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.

You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.

Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.

I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'

I'm off it!

<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.

Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.

Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.

Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.

Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.

What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?

Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.

I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

Hey, the poet...

Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.

It is to us!  It's computerised.

I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.

What?

Boca?

No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

You know I hadda meet some people tonight --

I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.

Yeah?

Fuck you, Santa Claus!

Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

Enchant.  Alain, j'ai rflchi  votre proposition et j'ai dcid d'accepter.

Are you having trouble raising the half million?

Non!

Il fallait le faire.

Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.

Marseilles.

Yeah, I know.

Willie Mays.

Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

Strike out, eh?

The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

Not a chance.

What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?

Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.

Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.

The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.

Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

Pour it in your ear.

Just for mistakes of parking?

For garbage?

Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.

I been damn careful up to now.

I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.

Elvis has left the building.

One in each ear.  What would you do without me?

He ain't the only one.

I'm serious.

Luck, my ass.

I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.

Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.

Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?

Uh, huh.

Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?

No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.

Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.

Daddy, I'm scared.

No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.

Wait...

Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.

Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.

Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.

Frank...Frank Sullivan.

What?

I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.

Nothing...I just spilled something.

What if it's not...

Johnny...?

I don't know.

Sun spot?

I'm thirty-five years old.

I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.

I lost you.

I never knew you, Dad.

Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.

I don't understand.

Tell me.

I'm glad.

Something happened, something...

He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.

I don't know...  What about the other women?

They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.

Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.

Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.

Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.

What...

Hang on.

We did it, John.  We stopped him.

What's wrong?

What the hell is that smell?

Whoa, I just...I just...

Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.

Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.

April 16...?  That means she was the first.

Yeah.  Sure.

Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.

Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.

Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.

Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.

You work too hard, John.

I try to be.

You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...

Where are you going?

Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.

Cool it, Andy.

I don't know...

Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.

I vote for me.

Barely.

Chuck... look.

Will you come with me?

Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?

I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?

You're irresistible.  I lose control.

Did you stay here last night?

I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?

I'm trying.  I'm really trying.

Destroy the evidence, Pronto!

Just keep your eyes on the road.

A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.

No way...  ...I wanna rock!

Why?

We're gonna scare him?!

He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?

You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.

This is taking forever.  I'm starving.

You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.

He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.

We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.

Daddy, what is going on?

Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...

No.

'Cause it stinks.

Come and get it.

I found it outside.

Are they grown-ups?

Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.

Will you listen, dammit!

There's no time for this bullshit...

No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.

But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.

They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.

Skin stretcher was human.

-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.

Do you have to ask?

Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.

Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.

Yeah...

Until I hear the truth.

The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.

About what?

Never.

Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.

Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...

Rennie's not coming.

It's...dead.

Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.

And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.

That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.

She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?

He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!

You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!

I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?

I don't know what to say...

Yeah...a lot.

There's something I haven't told you...

The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.

I want to go home. I want off this ship.

What do you mean???

Where are they?

I'm not going near any lifeboat!

Very big.

You are going where?

Very bad today.

That's where I peed.

Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.

Shut up, Elliot.

Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.

It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.

Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.

Where is it?

Paisley Porter.

About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.

She was very evasive.

What are you talking about?

This could be it.

Our Peter?

The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?

I go to college. I thought you knew.

That's completely crazy.

And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?

I have a class. I'm late.

First you tell me.

And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.

We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.

You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.

That's very lovely actually.

Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?

This could be it!

It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.

Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.

They're only gonna lose.

The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

Since when did that matter?

My back is killing me.

I can't find it.

Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.

Show him who we are.

The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?

He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.

Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?

I don't know Toyota. What does he do?

Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.

I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.

No. They're not your team. They're my team.

You're out of bullets.

Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.

To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.

He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --

The fact is, I have to get going.

And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.

They are boys. -- And they're Indian.

Are you sure?

"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."

Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.

I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.

Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?

I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.

No, no -- just a moment, please.

I thought you were against fighting.

The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.

Panditji -- please, help me.

I say when is now -- and we will determine how.

Hm.  Is it?

I --

That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.

I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

There is nothing I can give.

No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.

My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.

Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --

I dined at the prison.

Very well.

He's "discovering" India.

Have you found him?

Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.

It's over.

I like football.

Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.

A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?

It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.

Luca could still be an accomplice.

We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.

What a relief.

Thank you, no.

No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.

Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?

Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.

She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.

You may as well invite her here.

Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.

We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.

Antonio, the choir...

German, is that you?

How do I square the accident?

I'd have to bleach my hair.

You worried about the cost?

No.

I guess somebody beat me to it.

You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.

That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.

I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.

Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.

Not like <i>this</i> one.

I get my own help.

They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.

They may nail me into this now, McCoy.

I bet.

I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.

Yeah.

Small town, small bank, big money.

Better than old times.

Assumed name... Houston.

That Beynon's got a long arm.

Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.

No. It's been a long time.

After four years and now the question comes up.

We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.

If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.

If it's funny I'm going to laugh.

At least you were outside.

I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.

We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.

Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --

I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.

I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.

If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.

You sent me to him.

It isn't another boyfriend, is it?

No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.

Why, there's nothing on the news?

If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.

I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...

I think so... I don't know.

Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.

I don't see how.

Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.

We walk.

Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?

Tell her you robbed a bank...

Might try that.

What about the vault?

Aren't we going a little hard?

He took the day off.

Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.

I kinda doubt it.

Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.

Not now.

After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...

How?

What happened to this car?

This is my brother's car.

Was the steering faulty?

What?

That's nice.

Fine...  I want to talk to you.

What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.

Killed?  I don't know anything about it.

I must go. I'm in a hurry.

He was all right to me.

Nicer than most.

He was gentlemanly. I like that.

Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?

It's the truth.

Yes, I do.

Go on.

You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.

He won't. He thinks I'm simple.

Not entirely. No.

Expect so.

Working at Woolworths.

Yeah.

Thanks.

What?

Since when did he drink whisky?

Where you off to?

How'd you find me?

Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?

Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.

Don't ask me.

That little shit!

What about Keith?

Making a living.

Not till I'm dead, Eric.

Sod off.

Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?

No? Funny that. Neither did I.

Knock it off, Gerald.

Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?

That's right.

Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?

I had to.

What?

We're stuck with this fucking shit...

It's too...

Eh?

All of, they got you on this "board..."

I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.

Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."

Eh?

...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.

You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.

Nurses.

Yes.

Himself?

What?

The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.

Yes.

We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.

As a robbery.

No.  Not actually.

What did he say?

Is that what I said?

What does that mean?

Yes.  I'm sure.

...and rob the place...

Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?

Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?

I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.

What?  You can't do any what?

Huh?

Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.

That's...

You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.

He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?

Yes.  The cops.  No.

Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."

I was at home, where were you?

Why?

Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.

In school.

Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.

I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.

You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!

Could I...

Hey, fella, let's get this done...

And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.

...you didn't close...

Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...

I saw the board.  You've got four...

I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?

Because I say so.

Somebody broke in.

It's better than a good sale.  It's a...

What does that fucking mean?

It's not impossible.

You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.

You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...

Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.

I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 

I'm sorry.

Because I don't like you.

Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 

Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...

Mmm.

"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."

From the store.

Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...

He's right, Williamson.

Yes.

Sure.

Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...

Kenilworth...?

Me.

Mm.

Did I...?

She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...

I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...

Yest...

It's not me, it's my wife.

You tell me again.

We'll speak to her, Jim...

She told me I have to.

I do.  If I don't get my money back...

I...

And the check is...

What, they beat you with a rubber bat?

Yeah.  He closed a deal.

You did that?

Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.

Why not?

They didn't get my contracts.

The...

The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...

To do business.

I'm not hungry.

The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;

She couldn't decide.

This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.

Connie.

Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?

You're not my father!

Because I need MONEY!

I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.

Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.

A hundred years...it's a toast.

It's not talk; I'm doing it.

He will grow strong.

He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.

 You must understand, this is all new to me...

Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.

We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.

Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!

Mio fratello.

It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.

I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.

You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.

No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

 And he agreed?

I'm going to see my parents.

You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.

Yes.

I don't know.

I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.

I can't let him down.

Yeah, give me a minute.

But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...

But if you're wrong...

My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.

It was a boy.

Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.

His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;

That plane goes to Miami...

Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.

Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.

Mike wants it.

Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.

The room has a bug in it.

Tom, what do I do now?

Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.

Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.

We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.

Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

He is, I believe, a brother.

This meeting is adjourned.

This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.

Michael.

Get out of my hotel.

Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?

It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;

I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.

We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.

The money was sent.

I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?

No, I'm fine.

So?

Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.

That is a complete falsehood.

I do not.

We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.

Then why do you want me to lay down to them?

I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.

No, she's here.

We worked it all out beforehand.

You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?

We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.

Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.

We got no choice.

Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.

What was that?

I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.

Just thinking out loud.

All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.

Go wash glasses if you don't like it.

Maybe it's supposed to be funny.

What's to be jealous of?

All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.

I'm not a kid.

Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?

I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.

What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?

Expect nothing fancy.

Tea is fine.

No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?

Your wife?

No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.

No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?

There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.

What do I do?

But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?

Just that I was in the Marines.

You know what they say.  If you have to ask --

In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.

I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.

What's to sketch?

But why?

You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?

Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.

Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?

Your family ate dripping?

I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.

Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.

Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.

You don't think of me that way, do you?

Thoreau with a lawnmower.

What happened?

You've done a helluva lot more than most people.

I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.

There's no people like you in my crowd.

You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.

You don't want me to sit for you anymore?

Do I look okay?

Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.

The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.

A very lucky thing indeed.

That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.

I don't remember that one.

There are straps in back.

Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.

I haven't done a damn thing with you!

Oh Clayton.

You only embarrass yourself.

Then who did?

But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?

You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.

Oh dear.

Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.

Luminal.

She is beautiful.

I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.

It must be up in your old room.  I will look.

Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.

Sure.

Everything.  Start at the beginning.

But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.

No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.

Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.

Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

Is there someplace we can talk?

Six years ...

Tell me about Kip -

No, but you dress like an asshole ...

Me, too. Every time I walk...

Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...

One more night --

How is he?

Get out of here, then. Now.

No...

Kip.

You know my back.

Something like that -

Cadillac.

Not at all ...

Good.

No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!

Hey, Donny --

Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?

And there she is --

There's no one left ...

He didn't mess up. There it is ...

You, too, Ma...

How's Kip?

I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?

You remember that, Kip?

Yes, sir -

You guys are through...

Damn crooks is everywhere --

Just hold on... Hold on ...

Something like that -

Okay --

Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --

What?

Me.

Me...

I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...

Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...

Nah.

I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...

Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --

Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.

Hospital.

Call 'em here -- ?

What are you doing here?

Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.

On account of me.

Cut 'em...

I bet you say that to all the girls...

No worries ...

Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.

If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?

No we don't -

Who's "Eleanor?"

So what's in there -- ?

Not really --

No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.

Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.

Oh I Him.

Wha?  Me?

Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.

The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?

I don't want to hear about her anymore.

I got scared.

Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.

I gotta talk to you.

Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.

I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.

What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.

There's a shovel at my mother's.

Will you get the fuck out of here.

Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.

It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?

He's okay. They sobered him up.

I don't want them left back.

But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.

But, Paulie, please.

Oh shit.

That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.

Fuck you, you fat fuck.

What are we gonna do up there?

Jesus Christ. Not even close.

Why not?

Gone.

She went to Medical school in California.

Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.

Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.

So, you ladies ah, go to school here?

How you doin'?

--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--

And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.

You could put a pool in that backyard.

So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.

Shut the fuck up.

You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.

Retainer...

History.

Good, it was all right.

Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.

Which one's your building?

Well, he didn't show up for work today...

Hey fuck you.

Fuck do you want?

An integer.

C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.

Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.

I'm pretty sure it's right.

Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.

Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.

Yeah, cured polio.

The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.

I've been busy.

I got your card.

I need someone with your kind of background.

Five.

Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.

--Gerry--

Hold on!

--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!

If you push him into something, if you ride him--

He's not you!

Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.

I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.

You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?

Had one, now I'm fucked again.

Will, your not getting off that easy.

If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."

What did you think?

Yeah, it did take me a long time.

How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"

You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.

No.

This is a real piece of shit.

You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"

I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...

No, I don't.

I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.

Yeah.

Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.

Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.

What?

Define that.

Not to me, they're not.

I didn't want the job.

I didn't ask for this.

Cause fuck him, that's why.

It's not your fault.

It's not your fault.

Yeah, I think so.

You're Welcome, Will.

Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?

What?

You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?

I bet your parents were happy to pay.

Okay...

Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.

Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?

You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

How the hell did you do that?

I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.

What?

I'm not honest?

You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.

Well, I'm contracting the land.

You trying to tell me how to run my own business?

I never knowed they was anything like her!

Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.

We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.

I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.

Well, we ain't out a it yet.

I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.

Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.

Okay. Go on.

Why, you're the preacher!

Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.

I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.

He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.

I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.

That's our place.

They never wrote you nothing?

If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.

You're right!

Thought you was in jail.

I aim to.

I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.

Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.

But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?

Can't you see that sticker?

Yeah.

Naw--not much!

If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.

Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.

Didn' you have no breakfast?

Didn' none of these have no breakfast?

Ain't a-goin', thas all...

No longer'n we can get acrost her.

Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.

Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--

Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!

Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--

It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.

I'd a found you, Ma.

Don't taste bad.

Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.

You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.

They killed Casy first.

They know what--this fella looks like?

Don't know--but it's better'n this.

Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?

Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.

Then what, Tom?

There, them stripy ones.

Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?

Are you crazy?

That's what I asked you, ain't it?

But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!

Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.

Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.

Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.

Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!

Morning.

Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.

I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

I sell biscuits to the Southland.

I'm Martin Blank.

Whatever I can get away with.

Fine, Bob. How are you?

A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.

Insane.

Yes.

I'm a professional killer.

You see someone?

Bad experiences.

Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.

We haven't seen each other since high school.

Yes.

No.

That's probably a good idea.

Come on.

Like a club. Work less, make more.

Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.

Hello Martin. How have you been?

That sounds pretty interesting...

Yup.

All of it?

I'll do it tomorrow.

That's wonderful, Mom.

It's a place where religious people--

Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.

You too.

Work's good for the soul.

Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.

Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.

Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.

Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?

Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --

All by yourself?

Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?

You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.

Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?

You ever just stand still for a minute?

Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.

I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?

Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.

Need a lift?

Feel good?

You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?

Five years. My son was born here.

I won't ask you to.

Annie!

I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!

I brought it to you in the hospital.

Maybe they should put me down too.

Whatever you want.

I didn't know I had to.

What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!

Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!

Don't they believe in signs here?

There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?

Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?

You're right. Good.

Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!

... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?

Tom?

NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.

Well, now you know what it feels like.

What?... Oh baby...

Tom's gone.

So do you.

Good.

Hi.

I should be in by two.

Yeah. Bye.

We're very lucky.

Sing it to me, Frankie!

I love you.

All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.

Yeah.

No.

I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...

No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.

Okay.

You're allergic to hay.

Let's not talk about that now.

Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.

You want to take a walk with me?

Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.

Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.

She calls him Tommy...

Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.

I'd love to go there one time...

I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.

Yes, it does.

Promise?

Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...

Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.

That's what some folks say.

And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...

Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.

We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.

Sure.

No, you're only going to hurt him some more.

No!

You want to go to a movie tonight?

I just could never say it!

I'm okay... I'm okay.

OK, OK.

Maybe... look -- just...

I want to see Pilgrim.

I know. Amazing.

I did. He said he had work to do until late.

YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.

You ever miss it?

Honey... I was always good.

It's cool!

It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.

Alright sir.

...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!

Shh!

Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.

Again?  Yeah sure.

Yo, man, you an amateur, man.

That's far out!

A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.

Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.

Go fix the phones.

That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.

Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.

That's bullshit.

Burn!

It's cool, I'm just looking.

P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

You're not gonna win.

The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.

Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.

This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.

It's my subway defense system.

They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.

Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?

No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!

What's happening?

One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...

Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?

Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.

Virus?

Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.

All right.

So I have to watch Jamie tonight.

No, you don't understand.

Get back!

No. You son of a bitch!

Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.

It's okay..it's okay.

Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.

Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?

I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.

I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.

Drive Carefully.

Got it Earl.

Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.

You bet.

No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?

Oh Rachel!

I've got you come on, go down.

Then we'll be safe?

All right.

Hi.

Don't you mean what you do best?

Jamie?

This is 132, over.

He's here, Sheriff.

Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..

All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.

Yes.

Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.

You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.

Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?

Car trouble?

What's going on?

What happened?

You blame everything on kids.

Huh?

Why did you hang up on me?

Bye.

He was watching me.

Annie!

No, he's not.

...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.

Lee Brackett.

Could have...

He isn't a man.

If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.

Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...

I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.

I found the car! He's here!

No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.

Sure.

Sure. Sure.

I don't like that story.

Why are they under there?

There was no one outside.

Tommy, let me in!

I'm scared...

It's the bogyman, isn't it?

Let's make more popcorn.

Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

I notified everybody! Nobody listened.

You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.

He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.

What did you use before?

He'll barely be able to sit up.

I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'

What does that mean?

Shouldn't we pick him up?

Mm-mm!

You want to see some?

A lot of works.

Uh --

Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.

Oh, is that what it is?

Okay.

It depends on what way you want to go.

Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.

Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.

Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.

Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?

Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?

We're actresses.

I cry at the opera.

I'm an architect.

What time do you get off?

Uh-huh.

Yes.

Well...

Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?

You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.

Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?

Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.

'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 

What are you doing here?

Ohhhh!

Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.

Well, sure.

Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.

I have been in love with you for so long.

I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.

What do you expect me to say?

If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!

I care a great deal about him, yes.

I know!  I know!

But, you got four children!

No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!

Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.

Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.

Leave me alone, can you?!

You're not lost.

Yeah.

Always.

It's on the table, Dad.

Oh, honey!

How can we be happy?

But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?

Mom, come out!

Mmm...

Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.

Oh, Frederick!

I can't take this anymore.

Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.

Hello?

Like what?!  What?

You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!

Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!

No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.

Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...

I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.

Okay.

How are you?

Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.

Oh, now-- 

I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.

Huh?

Everything's good.  Everything's fine.

Wow!

Is there no chance?

Could you have ruined yourself somehow?

I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?

Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?

...from Mavis, also.

Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.

Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.

No, no, we decided!

Oh, sure.

Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?

I should get a garter belt.

Oh, your kids are so adorable.

Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?

Really?

Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.

Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 

What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?

You got it.

Yeah, that's clerical.

How?

Uh, losers!  All losers!

You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?

I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.

I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.

No!

Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.

...in a really horrible way.

Well, I hope you've changed.

No, well...I've been trying to write.

Really?

Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.

You've always hated my taste in the past.

You have.

What...what about your script?  So what's it about?

Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.

Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.

It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.

I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.

Oh, yeah?  What?

Just a few minutes ago.

Hmm.

Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.

...you don't have to think.

I'm going to tell you later....

...what <u>hindered</u> you...?

Or, perhaps...

Orderly.

I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.

And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.

Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?

Now, whyn't you help us?

Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.

Say it in English.

<u>That's</u> the spirit...

You want me to be?

...they did it for a lark.

I'm not.

...the whole world's out to get you...

You take this much time over everything?

Somewhere in Italy.

You said the <u>bad</u> news...

I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...

Starling, I've ordered you to shut...

You seen John Brigham...?

Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...

He requests your presence, once again, as part of...

And how did she get close enough to disarm you?

You nervous...?

'bout time you <u>learned</u>...

Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...

Hey, you know, I never thought of that...

And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?

Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?

I'll have them picked up.

Enchante.

Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...

If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 

...yes, yes, yes...

No. 

...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.

Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...

THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...

Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...

I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...

Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)

Spoken like a Protestant.

...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...

Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!

No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....

...not to turn around.

You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...

You got a lot of people love you, Starling.

Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...

Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 

Oh, my <u>program</u>...

...what did you want? 

I'm sure I don't know who you mean.

What shape is the scar?

No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...

I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 

....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...

I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.

...no...

No, I don't <u>think</u> so...

How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 

Yes.

Yes.

No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?

And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?

About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...

Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.

That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.

Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...

Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?

That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.

Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.

I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.

Oh thanks, it was nothing...

Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...

Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.

Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...

Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!

Yes you do.

Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...

Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.

And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...

Don't worry, you...

What do you want me to say?

Thank you, my love.                                         ]

What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?

Hey really, I don't feel so great.

Like last night, Veronica?

Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?

Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.

Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.

We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.

You goddamn bitch!

Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.

King David.

I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.

Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?

Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...

Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

Is she dead?

Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.

Give me the clipboard.

Yeah, where's your urge to purge?

Uh-huh.

Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?

Maybe it's time for a vacation.

S'okay....

Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.

Yeah. Scary stuff.

My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

French.

Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?

Of course.

How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?

She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.

Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.

Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....

You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?

What?

I thought I...you..

Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?

Shut the fuck up, all right.

Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.

This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.

That's three things.

Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.

playfully shoves his hand away.

Come on through.

breaks down into heavy sobs.

leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.

I just want to be on my own for a while.

It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.

Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.

gives her a sympathetic look.

Mummy!

Somebody's got to help us!

He . . .

Him . . .

You're such an incredible woman.

No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!

That was what we were led to believe . . .

I need my sodding parents' consent.

You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.

Second most common?

Eighty third most common.

Did I ever talk about Kirsty?

Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.

Really? Do tell.

I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 

Allison Dormere. Your intern.

What's the difference?

Zero's a number right?

What?

In a word? Lucrative.

Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.

What?

It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.

I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.

That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.

A little? Try unbelievably.

Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.

I don't work here.

Wow you are out of it.  

Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.

Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.

Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...

YOU!

I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.

I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?

They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?

LaPlante!

Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.

Right.

It was you!  I thought I heard...

Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.

I understand.  How often do you see your son?

So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.

You mean John Bubber?

Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.

When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.

You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?

DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"

I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!

You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --

Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...

What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?

Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...

A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...

In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.

You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.

Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...

What picture?

I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?

You were saying you don't want a million dollars.

It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.

Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...

A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...

It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.

No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...

You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!

This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?

Unprofessional.

Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.

She's talking to him now.

I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...

Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.

Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.

How are they with kids?

Okay.

Whoa, check it out.

A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.

Right.

Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --

Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.

I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.

Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.

No, no, no, no.

Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.

Maybe I could take a look at it now.

Just show me the way.

-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.

Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.

Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.

Uh huh.

"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"

Did Daddy tease you?

Holly -- that's not so.

Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.

Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.

I've asked him what's wrong.

"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."

Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?

I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.

The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?

Mom, I heard someone downstairs!

Stop knowing me so well.

High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.

It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.

One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.

Oh, honey.

There might be some extras in the garage.

Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.

Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.

Grow up, Dreyer.

Do you have enough money?

No.

Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!

And I can't help having a cold.

Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!

No.

Really.

Talk to me about what?

They appear to be authentic.

It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.

I think it was England.

So?

No.

That is what bothers me.

And what do you think you will find in another land?

I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.

Where I'm going you cannot follow.

Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?

He was wearing a bullet proof vest.

You got me.

Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?

Jennifer.

I've lived all over the world.

Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?

I wanted to get to know you better.

A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.

Where is the film crew from the British Museum?

I don't think it is a duplication.

I was working on the cataloging.

We'll see.

This cannot be.

I'll no forget you.

Fine.

It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?

It was stolen.

Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.

You won't die if you let me help.

Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?

That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --

That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.

I'm not going to die for this!

The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?

How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?

You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.

Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?

Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.

I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.

Give me an ETA.

What hospital?

My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.

You said they would be here!

We'll see you in a couple of hours.

But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.

You sure?

You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.

We can't make the microwave work.

I don't know what you're talking about.

What are you doing?!  Stop that!

Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --

York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.

Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.

If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.

Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!

Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?

Are all of you named Jones?

What?

Where's the office?

I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.

How do I reach him?

You can let go.

We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.

These disks . . . where are they?

I guess we do.

They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.

And four children?

I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.

Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.

Yes we have.

We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.

Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.

Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.

It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.

Watch everything? How? They are gone.

Satellites?

The front gate would be best, General.

You said you had no whiskey.

No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.

No.

No, sir.

Listen, you need me.

You think they will believe you?

At least.

I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.

Take the river road back. It is clear.

Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.

What is it?

Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?

I don't have to listen to you anymore.

Please, except my humblest apologies...

I would never do that.

I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.

That will take time.

Call, sir?

We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.

He will be here.

One thousand francs.

They have him in the lobby, go quickly.

How do you know?

I will give you my house.

They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.

I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.

Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.

Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.

What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.

No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.

No, Odette says he's in shock.

No. They are not dead. Stop this.

It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.

We have to get out of here Tatiana.

I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.

Get on the truck, Tatiana.

What's wrong?

Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.

Thank you, sir.

Go downstairs, I will help you.

If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --

I'm confused.

-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"

-- the whole thing is falling apart!

But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!

Okay: this may sound crazy, but --

Not at all!

-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?

No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.

Ms. Marr!

Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.

As a tumor.

I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --

Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.

Nothing.

Did it work?

What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?

It's not going to let us out!

Up here --

Over here!

Take the gun.

Best of a nightmare.

I thought she was dead. For sure.

Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.

No -- keep pulling, it's moving!

-- that's the fact, bud --

Let's try down here...

He's gotta still be down here.

He's dead...?

For chrissake give me a hand!

Jesus!

Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.

How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?

Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?

-- I pose you the same question --

-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --

What?

Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??

Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.

-- my loss --

What?

Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.

Or somebody wanting me to believe that.

Something with the power, I don't know!!

Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?

Well, I can't, sweetheart.

Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.

Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.

Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.

-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.

Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.

He must've unsealed the room!

What was her name?

What will they tell you?

I'm sorry.

Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...

Maybe it was Colleen...

Ok...

Go to your room!  Now!

He's blessing the house.

Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...

Yeah I'll look into that tonight.

Whatever you say.

To our family.

Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?

I don't know.  That's strange.

I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.

Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.

I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.

Know what?

I'm ok.

I'm all right...

We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.

You'll have to settle for turkey.

Yes, I am.

Aubrey?  It's mommy.

Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...

We'll be there.

It was nailed to the cellar wall.

Not at all, if it can help.

Jesus Christ ...

Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.

You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?

Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?

And why are you back?  Why are we here?

The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.

Where?

Right.

Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.

No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.

Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?

Would you know this store again?

No.  We want ...

On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?

Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?

I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.

Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.

Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.

Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--

Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?

Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.

Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.

But I said I was sorry....

I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome

It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

Ooh-kay...

Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....

As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...

Yeah.  The big E.

Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!

Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.

When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...

That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

Like a "cat", one could say.

Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.

We're here to say, your government was right.

You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?

You want an address on that last one?

How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."

Yes.

For God's sake, chain this convict.

Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.

You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.

Bastard!  If you were a true American.

Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...

I'm supposed to fall for that?

They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.

Sharp.

What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.

But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.

Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --

I'm happy enough.

He didn't offer you money.

Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!

You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --

I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...

Oh, no, really, I --

Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.

Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.

Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!

Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?

Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?

You know, on farm route 17.

No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!

What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?

Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.

That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...

Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!

Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --

Now, Aim --

Now, Aim --

Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --

Phony, huh?

Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.

He grins wolfishly.

So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.

I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --

But, buddy, you were --

And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!

Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.

Nah, that's all forgotten.

Norville.

Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.

Well, why don't ya read it.

'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'

Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!

Well, I'm a college graduate --

Oh my God, sir!

-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --

No, Bennie: Lumbago.

He don't look wise.

Thank you for waking me.

I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.

Ti-Misery?  What's that?

But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?

Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.

That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.

I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.

I've never heard of a cure.

Thank you.

I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.

Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.

A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.

That's rather nice, isn't it?

Thank you.  But who sits there? 

Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.

I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.

Of course, Wes.

You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.

Yes, thank you.

Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.

If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.

Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --

Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---

Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --

I love Fort Holland.

Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?

But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...

It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...

Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.

In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.

Got a meeting uptown.

Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?

And as usual no one believed me...

That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.

You want to go?

Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.

Hmm. Good night.

You know Elena, I've been thinking--

What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.

Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.

Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?

Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?

Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.

Fine.

Birth control.

Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.

Nothing.

Jesus all right enough!

Huh?

And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --

That's besides the point.

Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?

-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --

-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --

Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.

I suppose we'll make an appearance.

Let me.

You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.

Well, we can talk about it.

Hi Wendy.

We were just riding around.

It's really quite all right.

Social work?

You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.

They say you never forget.

All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?

I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.

I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.

Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?

Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.

See ya.

Um, Libbets Casey.

My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --

Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?

You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.

Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.

I don't have a girlfriend.

Out.

Tell Sandy? What?

Wendy!

Maybe. Can't really tell yet.

Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?

Charles, what time is it?

Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.

The ones you built?

Vodka?

Huh?

That's nice. Are you drunk?

Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.

About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?

I had him!

Okay.

About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.

Why?

Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.

We just gotta catch the bastard, right?

What I saw?

Has her books in it.

What?

Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.

Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...

But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.

Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...

Huh?

She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.

Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?

The other guy?

That's a long time.

Who?

Who?

What was it?

Yes.

I didn't want to kill her, Will.

Yes, and very beautiful.

Are you the leader of tis group?

Nothing if not vampires...

You said there were none.

Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.

I have. Or there would be twice as many.

Stop her Louis!

Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.

No. Laudanum.

What have you done?

Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.

And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.

It is! Take the back stairwell -

No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.

Be still!

What danger?

That's not so.

Yes...

And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?

I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?

They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...

Give it to me!!!

You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.

I can't go through with it, I tell you.

Dying?

You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.

And if I don't?

We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?

I don't know any hell -

Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!

What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!

Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?

I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!

Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.

What are you saying?

Lestat, what do you mean?

Don't try to speak... it's alright...

I tried...

Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.

You're not lying to me, are you?

The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.

Can a vampire feel love?

I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.

Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...

He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.

Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?

July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.

Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.

No.

Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --

Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.

I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.

Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.

Can't what?

This weekend?

Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.

Fine. Show me the body.

Wait, it's Nancy --

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

He's in it with Willis?

Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.

We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.

Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!

Why?

I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.

How's Julie?

Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?

No. I shot him.

And so could you -- crazy fool.

Must have missed the sign.

Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?

So why are you still here?

How's the water?

You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --

And do what with it?

Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.

You collect these to sell, abroad?

He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.

I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --

All the graves?

I donut understand.

No.  She shall not be left here.

I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house

Poor Cathy --

I don't know now without my father.

She has never mentioned her family.

How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.

That your father and I 

Would you care to explain what you're talking about?

I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..

I don't understand you.

If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.

Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.

Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --

This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.

We still don't know that it's the plague 

Listen to what I say --

It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.

How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?

Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?

Carter  bank examiner.

Suicide.

What are you, a mind reader or something?

Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?

I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.

I said I wish I'd never been born.

Our clothes are dry.

Made what?

Yes, George?

Sit down? What are . . .

That's your problem, George Bailey.

That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.

That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.

Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.

No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.

What's that book you've got there?

The Building and what?

I know. I know.

You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.

Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.

I'm working across on a cattle boat.

Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.

Nice girl, Mary.

Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?

Uh-huh.

Aw, forget it.

Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .

I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.

He's pretty young for that job.

Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.

Hello, Violet.

Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.

Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.

George . . .

And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .

The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.

Well, what about the Building and Loan?

Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?

I'd like to do that.

I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.

Five hundred dollars.

In that place?

Come on, tell me.

What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .

Would you rather leave?

Thank you.

That does it  come here.

Thanks for dropping around.

Left them at the office.

Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.

Going up to see Zuzu.

Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!

What plates?

Oh, shucks . . .

You going to the lighthouse?

Well, I don't know....

What the hell.  For you....

How fast is enough?

What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?

Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.

Stop paddling!

Back down!

Good.  It's terrible.

Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!

Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!

Gangway, Turkies!

You bet.  Hang on....

Can you get us a line?

If there is, develop it!

Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?

About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....

But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.

Got it.

You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.

You stay right here.  You're going in with me.

Not till next year.

Sean's still out there.

You said something about a camera.

Too late, it's written.

Come on, let's check the bite radius.

Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?

Look, I know a little bit about sharks.

And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.

What're you guys doing today?

Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?

Terrific.

Are you going to be able to sleep?

That's great.

Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.

Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.

I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?

Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!

What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!

What for?

That's it?

Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.

Shouldn't he be at home?

Hiya yourself.

Shh.  Shhh....

It's all right, we're okay.

Seventeen.  She's a senior.

Nope.

You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.

That's a crock of shit.

Double nope!

Wait a minute.  Promise me something.

Figure they split?

Name it.

I love it.

Maybe.

How the hell do we get him down. from there?

I can get it.

No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.

Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.

It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.

Coming with us?  Overman's buying.

What is it, 97 days?

They're acting very strange suddenly.

Honey, I gotta go.

Hi, baby.

That's a lot of ground to cover.

Let's not talk about that now, okay?

That we swim.

It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.

Yes.

I know I can capture it.

I got it on sale.  A real steel.

How's your patient?

I don't want to see them, Kathryn.

So tell Calvin.

Hydrophobia...

I can't take water, Kathryn.

That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.

You two go!  I'll call Calvin!

Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.

... Okay.

Who's going to do it?

Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?

I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.

So do I, love.

I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!

Skillful?  I missed my first shot.

Somebody could have gotten hurt.

Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.

The water ski show!  We have to get them out!

She, Mister Hutton.

The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.

And big for his age.

Sure.  No problem.

And alone.

The one that goes underwater?

No, Kelly, I don't want to...

Can hardly wait to do it again.

What, hon?

Don't you dare.

That?

Calvin said it was all right.

Precisely.

So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?

What the hell's there?

Polar bears in Georgia???

No way.

Always do.

I know.  But we show it's not closing.

So was Dad.

Don't hurry back.

It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.

It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.

Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.

That's what grandmas are for.

Because....

Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?

I can't help it....

Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?

Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....

I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....

I'm hungry, Mom....

You can stay in my room.

I'm still five....

You're silly....

Thanks for the consultation....

I'll miss you....

I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....

It picked Sean...It killed your father....

Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....

Come on, I'll show you around.

Mom, please don't start that again....

I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....

I'm fine....

I have to get this finished.

There's nothing to worry about....

I don't want to talk about that.

Why'd you come out here?

I always listen to my feelings....

It could have been an accident....

No one does till they learn....

Where do I pull off...?

They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....

It's wonderful....

I have my own little island.

What?

I'm sorry...I....

You're the man who drives the plane.

Just like that?

Yes I can....

We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....

She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....

What's that....?

I fly elephants for smugglers....

Still chasing fish?

She's a tough lady....

Oh, boy....

The females have eggs....

A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....

You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....

Put me down....

Put me down, damnit....

I didn't do it on purpose....

Forget it....

Don't say anything about this to my mother....

As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....

We got it together, Jake....

So did I....

Lots of times....

What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?

As long as he's been here....

What do you know about him?

You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'

You don't like my voice...?

Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'

Mom....

I've got to get to her....

It'll work....

Don't flatter yourself.... 

I just want to make an honest woman of you....

I'm training to....

Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.

No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-

I hope I'm not intruding?

Since when did you drink diet soda?

Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.

Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?

I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?

Then give me that Zippo.

How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?

What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..

No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.

You don't really believe this?

I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..

This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.

Hey ..

Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.

I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..

No.

Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?

You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.

Fucken noddle's hanging off ..

I've heard you call him Freddy.

As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?

What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?

Why not? You heard my voice?

No, it has a mind of its own.

My hands?

.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..

Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..

It's not possible right now.

I can't identify him ..

I'm blind because my father drank.

I don't want them to arrest you.

I been told to take your car in, Sir.

I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.

Yes, Sir.

No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..

You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..

Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.

Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..

Even better.

No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.

Jerry, this is what intimacy is!

I know about the bachelor party.

One of the accountants.

Could you just stop moving?

No.

There is something missing here.

No.

Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.

Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.

I see what you're saying.

"Something in the way.  Yeah."

Oh come on --

Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --

Hmm.  Pretty good.

Well, take care.

Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.

Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.

Absolutely.

Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --

Well, I'm happy for you.

Sure.

Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?

Same to you.

Right.  I'll come in.

Easy, easy --

Fine, I just --

No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...

Why do you love me?

Tell me -- let me help --

I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.

Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.

Of course, medical! _ 42.

Of course I know --

At eleven at night? _ 70.

Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.

That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.

I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.

Okay.

Now you want Arizona dollars.

Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.

Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.

I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."

Very much.

Huh?

Why not?

I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?

I missed ya.  What can I say?

--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...

Jerry.  You two will be together forever.

Not a chance.

What DO you stand for???

Don't be silly.

I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --

"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...

The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.

I came here to let you go. _ 27.

I know.  It sucks.  I suck.

Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.

We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.

Funny.

Right up ahead, buddy --

We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.

What?

A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.

People change.

Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

Nothing.

No, it's...

Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

We have to help him.

I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?

We're not going anywhere, I promise.

I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!

Here!

What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

Just hold on.

I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

He loves you too.

Sure.

They're here.

No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!

It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...

Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.

Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

Really?  What do you do there?

You think they could talk to each other?

Goodbye, Alan.

You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.

Which one do you prefer?

Are you sure?

She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.

You should.

There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.

Back out! Move!

Just a little bit too much, I think.

Minimal.

It doesn't matter what I think.

Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.

Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?

After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.

Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --

-- my --

Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.

Kelly!  What are you doing here?

That was about a year ago.

Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.

This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.

Where does it say that?

You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.

To collect my fee.

I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.

Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.

The velociraptors.

Good.

Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.

Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.

Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.

Where's Kelly?

Funded by whom?

Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-

Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.

Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.

Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -

Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?

I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?

Shhhhh!

Are you sure?

Oh my God.

Oh my God.

A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 

That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.

Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.

They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.

The Cretaceous.

Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!

Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....

What kind of park is it?

We were right!

We're out of a job.

Dilophosaurus.

It's my favorite.

Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.

I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!

The fences are electrified, right?

The other car!

What's that?

You can't just stroll down the road, you know.

Okay.

We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.

Like hell it is!

I get ah - -

It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -

Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?

No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!

Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.

Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.

Because he's like me.  He's a digger.

And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.

Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -

Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.

That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.

This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.

It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?

You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!

You have no idea.

You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.

You want to talk about this?

For today, I guarantee it.

What kind of opinions?

The brachiosaur?  Thirty.

Wu?

Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.

Oh, I hate the other kind.

It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!

Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!

Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?

John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.

You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.

I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.

There's no sign of him anywhere.

Sure.

Excellent.

Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!

Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.

Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?

Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...

Great.

Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?

That's my job.

I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.

What?

No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.

None of that's true?

You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.

Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.

Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.

Great.	When can you do it?

How's that possible?

Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.

Except this victim got away. I wonder if --

I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.

What is it really?

What was the matter with it?

You were his friend.  One link is all they need.

-- Small.

I don't know what you could have read.

I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.

There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.

What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?

In a manner of speaking.

No, I left it in his office.

You're detestable.

You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?

Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?

-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.

I know.

Why would you suppose so?

This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.

Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.

Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.

Last year.  I -- it was broken off.

You won't have any trouble finding it.

They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.

People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.

Why were you given notice?

Now Burgel's one of the authorities?

There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.

Wednesday.  We left the office together.

No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.

No, I suppose not.

That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.

It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.

When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...

A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?

... A piece of paper ...

It usually is.

Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.

Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.

These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?

My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.

It's ... lovely.

To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.

Now Ann ...

I photographed it extensively, father.

Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.

You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!

I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.

Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.

A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb

Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!

Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!

What?

How about Ann? Is she going with you?

Yeah.

Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.

She was with you after she left Frank.

And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --

Please --

Yes?

You think people hate you.

No.

No, that's not --

Mm.

No, I'm look --

Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --

OK.

I go on rounds.

What do you think?

No.

You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.

I don't see anything, do you?

No, I said what did you think.

Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --

Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.

Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.

-- Then you don't need me.

I don't get you.

I don't like getting splashed.

Mm.

What am I supposed to say?

Don't touch anything.

OK.

I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.

How is it back there?

Well as a matter of --

Yeah.

Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.

Someone's been doing all these things.

Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.

Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.

It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.

Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.

It's not so bad.

No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --

Goodbye, Pete.

Two years ago? Sorry.

Did she talk about him to you?

Are you with plant security, Sergeant?

Yeah.

I don't know. It looks familiar to me.

What else do you know?

Trask --

He's in his room, playing.

Not particularly.

The prospect of losing my child.

What about your mommy?

Greatest...

Show...

Wow!  French toast, really?

Right.  One O.J. coming up.

Uh huh...

In a minute...

That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.

Some of the brown stuff is still there.

I love you...

It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...

You like it?

Sure.

I guess about the same kind of things you do.

Why does he decide?

Sustained.

Yes, your honor.

Does the witness deny the injury took place?

Six years.

Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.

Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.

Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?

Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.

Thank you.  I have no further questions.

What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.

How many lovers have you had-- permanently?

Ted, I'm leaving you.

Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...

I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--

Such as?

I mean it Ted, you're running this one.

I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.

I don't know, Jim...

Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.

Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.

Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.

That's my decision, Ted and that's final.

Are you firing me, Jim?

Sure.

Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...

Right.

I'm going to take it.

But it's not a year from now, is it?

Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.

I know....I know.

No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.

I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.

Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.

Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.

Ted, all I wanted to know was where--

No.

Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.

Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.

Got it.

No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.

Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.

Ted, I just heard...

Kham, Holiness.

Again?

Can I do anything I want?

Here. We'll collect them.

You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.

To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.

I will not approve it.

And we will begin with tearing it down.

General Chiang.

Soon.

We did not.

Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.

Yes.

At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.

I miss my brother.

What do you think?

I am him.

Please.

Can India help us?

The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.

The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.

I will not go.

Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.

He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.

You will always!

Does he have the spot?

True.

Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.

And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.

They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.

Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?

Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.

The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.

Oh yes.  I killed him.

Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.

Go ahead.

I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.

Mr. Cyr!

They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.

Cocktail?

I coulda shot you, you--

No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.

I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?

It came from across the lake.

Raincheck.

Then do it!!

Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.

I don't know!

Right.

Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?

Nothing's real.

Guess I finally got bit.

Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?

Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...

I'd be able to see something.

I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.

Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.

I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.

Take him.

No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.

Yeah.

Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?

Good thinking.

Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.

Let's go.

White perch.

So does he.

And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?

I can look at dead things.

Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.

It's just that--

Was he swallowed?

I thought I saw...

I asked you to be nice to him.

Hector thinks you like him.

She's worried about the cow now.

Me too.

The somebody else part?

Else.

It's ten after nine.

It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--

Kelly--

Well, except for the one girl.

Hot damn, Clarice.

Get me out!

Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.

Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.

Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?

Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.

Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.

Jack Gordon.

Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.

I hope so. They haven't posted anything.

You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.

It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.

Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?

Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -

I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.

Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.

He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?

Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?

But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!

Starling -

Sewing...

They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.

Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.

I think so.

May I see your credentials?

He said - "I can smell your cunt."

All that detail, just from memory...?

Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.

I didn't.

A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.

Why? Do you know something about him?

That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.

Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.

Was it a butterfly?

You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.

Why so briefly?

How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?

No. We just -

Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -

And - one morning I just - ran away...

No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...

Yes...

Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.

No fair! You lured him with produce.

Officer Starling. Welcome back.

The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?

Can we rest soon?

Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.

Let us go, miss.

Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...

Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."

Why did they turn back?

In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?

Yes. I want you to go.

There was none!

He delivered no such message.

Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.

You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.

What the bloody hell plan is this?

What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!

He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?

I ought to have you whipped from this fort!

You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.

: Only one or two loads.

We'll see in the morning...

You're not coming with us?

No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.

...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...

And what is that?

I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.

Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?

Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.

And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."

General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.

The decision is final.

Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?

Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.

And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.

Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.

However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.

My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.

Carry them to England to your King with pride.

Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.

Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--

These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.

But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?

Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.

What has?

What dead one on the ship?

Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!

No.

I got hung up!  Try this!

How do you know it was Williams?

Why can't we pick up his signal?

Good...It's going good.

I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?

Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.

Seeing how my stock's doing...

How much time does that give us?

Where's Jones?

Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.

Roger.

Okay.

And it killed Bo?

What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.

I'm not anxious to find out, either.

Do it.

I realize you must have gone through hell--

Not yet.

Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!

Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.

Hook's on 24...

I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..

I'm going to kill it!

Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...

We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...

Let's hope it holds.

Sixpack...

Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...

He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.

Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

Well, it's still a good idea.

Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.

I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.

I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.

Apart from those shotguns.

Where're the others?

Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.

It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

Can I help?

No Harry, you can't.

It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.

Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.

Try that one.

All right, Dad.

This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.

Er well, yes we do.

There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.

Just hold on, I got the keys.

OK, open the gate.

Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?

I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.

Right as rain.

What do you mean, me?

. . . What?

No, you need five hundred grand to see me.

It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

I wanted to talk to you about that.

I like your bar.

Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?

I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.

Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.

That's going on optimism.

When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.

Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

Just shut up.

You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.

Oh, come on, Amado--

Leave your sister out of it.

They stole our land--

Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.

Follow orders. Do whatever they say.

The--the officers.

It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.

No, sir. Not at all.

Yes, sir.

From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.

Thank you, Sergeant Major.

If I had I wouldn't have gone in.

Yes, Sergeant.

Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.

We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.

Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--

You got to investigate. No question about it.

You're fired. You're outta the department.

--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--

You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--

What?

If it's too late--

No sir.

They fought against the Indians?

By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.

I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--

How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?

Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.

You own this place?

You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--

He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!

Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--

You know who it was they dug up?

This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.

That's where he fell.

Nice to meet you, Ma'am.

We have an enlisted man's club at the post.

The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.

Protection?

Aqui! [Here!]

Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]

En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.

We was crossin' the river--

Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]

Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--

You go by your old house?

You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?

No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?

There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.

Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.

Do you?

Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.

I'm unmarried. I'm not available.

Well, you hire illegals--

A little older than Paloma is now.

You ever play one of these?

And that was the last time you saw him?

And when my father was Sheriff?

Yeah?

I only went for my last two years.

Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.

I'm surprised he bothered with it.

Well, you were working there--

Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--

He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?

I can't name anybody she does like these days.

Most people did, yeah.

Yeah.

Pilar--

Yeah.

You know the other day, you asked why I came back?

Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.

Pilar--

What was your father's name?

Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--

If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.

Yeah--

I been working on a few things.

This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--

You sell much out here?

Runnin' numbers illegal.

You going to tell him?

Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.

How?

Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.

My life was too weird for her.

Nope.

doorway) And who's that?

Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.

D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.

Right.

Why would I do that?

All right.  It was...

About?

What about death?

It's him... it's him.

And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?

Yes.

I'm no bodyguard.

I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.

They won't tell you anything.

Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.

Why?  Because he had you?

You didn't marry him for love.

It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.

I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.

I wasn't.

I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.

Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.

And they all came...

Harry...

Yeah.  Remember Quaid?

So could you walk on water?

Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?

You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.

Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.

You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.

No.

Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?

We've got to get you to a hospital.

What about?

Not much.

It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.

Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.

Is that all?

Is that all?

No.

He's better off this way.

In my time, and nobody else's.

What?

And he's dead?

Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...

25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?

Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?

Hi. Did you have a nice swim?

I'm here for the week.

Hi, Charlie.

Ok.

OK, see you downstairs.

I see them every morning.

I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?

Yeah, you don't remember?

No, you smiled.

I know, I kind of blend in here.

Ok, whatever you want.

No, yes, it does...

I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...

We should get you to the doctor.

No.

That lunch was the worst, huh.

I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.

Oh?

Hello, darling.

Is there anything I can do?

Alright?

Fine.

Hello, Bob, it's me.

Fine. Is it going ok?

Do you want to- 

That's ok.

Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!

Thank you, Mr. Harris.

Excuse me?

That's ok, you'll figure it out.

Bye.

Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.

I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?

Have you met Charlotte? My wife.

Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...

It's probably trivial.

Bad?

Sushi.

I found the pentacle.

And how would you describe him?

On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?

Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.

My secretary?

Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.

I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.

Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.

You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.

Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.

I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.

Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.

Kelson, hold on a second...

...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.

I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.

Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?

On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?

I think you gave me the wrong one.

You're right.  I must've made a mistake.

Please, the children.

At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.

What?

I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.

Until it happens, you're still a human being.

We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.

You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.

We millionaires yet?

No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.

As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.

Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.

He's looking right at me.

Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.

Where is she now?

Nothing.

Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?

Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...

Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.

Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.

To that stewardess?

You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?

What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.

Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.

When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.

But you use potato?

It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.

You love to pose so much, let's see it again.

Sort of.

Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.

I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.

You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.

Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...

How'd you get him to say yes?

Just wanted to say good game.

But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

Just like that?

Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.

I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.

She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.

I don't.

I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

Yeah.

Yeah.

He ain't Spalding.

None of your business.

Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.

I know, right?

I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.

I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.

Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

What?

My court, I go first.

I wanted you to.

I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.

Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.

Are you out of your mind?

I never asked you to choose.

I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?

Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.

Uh huh.

Yup.

Not for Quincy McCall.

Getting there.

That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?

Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...

Maybe go back to school.

What?

I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.

I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.

I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...

Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.

"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.

I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.

I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.

Okay...

What?

A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.

We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...

I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.

Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.

What?

Came by to check on you.

I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.

I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.

Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.

I'm here, I'm listening.

I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --

Brain and Lung.

It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?

...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --

baby, please, please --

YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.

GET OUT.

GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

No one else in there with you?

And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?

You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?

I'm a bit of a slob myself.

Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --

-- do you wanna cup?

I don't have a boyfriend.

-- is not my boyfriend.

This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --

What's that stand for?

I'm sorry.

Bye.

Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --

Well I don't go out very much.

I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.

I'm sorry --

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

What?

That was so great what you just said.

You don't know how crazy I am.

Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.

What?

I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --

Claudia.

yeah, yes, hi, hello.

How much time do we have?

I should maybe go to the bathroom.

I don't know.

Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.

NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.

If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.

-- no.

Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.

Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"

Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.

This sounds threatening.

I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.

You're a friend of the family I presume?

I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.

Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.

Mmm.Hmm.

Stay that way.

You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.

FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --

Yes I do.

Don't do this, Don.

Where is he?

She loves you.

There's no asshole like you.

Go fuck myself?

Who are you gonna call?

No.

I'm looking for Frank Mackey.

You got us a room so quick?

So boring, so useless --

-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?

This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --

Mm. Hm.

An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?

Go ahead and waste your time.

-- fuck you.

Around here.

Well I guess it doesn't.

Not a problem.

...this close...

What name?  My name?

My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.

"Frank" was my mother's father.

I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.

Yeah let's...maybe just stand.

Oh yeah.

Mmm.

yeah.

I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --

Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.

No.

If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.

I won't.

I got in trouble at school.

Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --

I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!

It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.

I'm drinking.

Yeah.

Did you ever touch her?

Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?

It's alright.

No.  But I probably will get a call back.

I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.

The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --

-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.

Hang up the phone.

-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --

Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.

That's it.

We need more dog food --

Should be one-thirty.

Sure.

Go to bed.

I have money.

I have money to give you.

That is good.

I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.

I wish to discuss your brother.

First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.

Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.

There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.

Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --

Three days??!!

So what has changed?

Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.

Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?

Forgiveness?

No, not Louis!

What use am I?

Come on...

Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.

Who?

We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.

Who does?

You are right.  But it is a trap.

Raoul --

Athos, my friend!

Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?

I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.

I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.

I know.

You trust his character more than anyone else does.

I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.

No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!

Whose rooms are those?

How did you --

Just... water.

Who came?

And you never knew why?

I decided it this morning.

I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!

It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?

There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.

Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!

Thank you, your Majesty.

Forgive?!

There.

Thank you, Keeper.

Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.

How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?

Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.

It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!

Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--

I didn't hit shit!

Fine...

Fine -

Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.

That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?

Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.

Could explain why Fleming was there.

He said he was following up some lead.

I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!

I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.

Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?

This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--

Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?

Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!

Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?

Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...

Screw him!

County jail - get in.

Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...

Could he handle a direct contact?

The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.

It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.

Book code?

I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.

What else did you keep out of the papers?

As long as they're dead...

I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.

He's working on the single print index. What time is it?

We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?

The mark? Yes.

Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?

What is it?

...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.

We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.

Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.

When I'm done.

'Changes?'

VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?

There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.

Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...

Stay in the trees.

Wait for the back-up! Will?

He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'

He went to the men's room.

Tonic will be fine.

No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.

Francis? Where are you?

No!

My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.

Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.

Not me.

No.

'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'

No.

Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....

It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.

Hi, Linda. ..

We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.

Cut the general crap.

Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?

Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.

Yes. I said this is too good to live...

No.

I have to go back to Birmingham.

No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.

Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...

Go on to the house...

Yeah...

Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.

No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

...after a while.

Stuart is fine.

I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.

I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.

You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.

...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?

Tank you veddy much.

And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!

I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.

Hi George!

Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"

But George, I like to push the boundaries...

You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.

I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!

So who's gonna pay for it?

You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.

You've got good days and bad days.

Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...

Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...

Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...

No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!

But it's only for thirty seconds!

I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.

Hi... am I late?

No thanks.

Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."

Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.

If you want...

They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.

Then your father's a wimp.

Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.

No!  Andy, don't do it --

What is this, World War Two...?

No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!

And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"

The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.

It is apparently not working.

Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.

I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --

I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.

Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!

Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.

Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!

And you are?

We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.

If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.

Hear what?

Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

He's going to pop!

I got you.

Go.

Shit!  Apoc?

They'll be able to track it.

Five minutes.  Maybe six.

Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?

Yes.

What do you know?

Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

The Matrix?

You've never used them before.

What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.

A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?

I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.

Because... I didn't think I would?

What -- what lesson?

She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.

That I would find the One.

Morpheus, I don't know --

Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?

I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.

How did you know...?

Who?

Honestly?  I don't know.

How do you know that name?

They're watching you, Neo.

Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.

It's going into replication.

... right as rain.

Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.

A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.

We can't leave him!

I believe I can bring him back.

It wasn't fast enough.

I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.

Guns.  Lots of guns.

He's alive.

You're not far from Cypher.

I'll be all right.

Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?

Anybody wanna have a game?

Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.

Giovanino!  Where have you been?

Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.

All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?

Wouldn't bother me.

I could have told you that.

I understand.

He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.

I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...

OK, get in.

Ok...that's it.

C'mon Johnny.

Yeah, thanks, it's ok.

'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'

'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!

You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.

I know.

That's nice.

Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...

Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?

Oh yeah, that's a possibility.

What was it?

No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.

What is it now?

A paper on that one too?

I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.

You're intolerable today.

Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?

But...

Which one, the big tab or the little tab?

No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.

You could say that.

Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.

Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --

Yeah, speak for yourself.

Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?

No.

I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --

We've got some things to discuss.

From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.

Yeah?  And what about my enemies?

Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!

No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.

But what?

I'm sorry, I don't recall --

You mean this, sir?

How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?

Hi.

What 'business'?

What side of the industry did you say you were on?

What'd it say?

'Yes' to the deal?

Do you think I need a haircut?

How nice for you both.

For how long?  And why?

Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.

Bontecou wants a quick response and --

So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?

Certainly, Bill.

You get not to go to jail.

Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --

'It's up to Joe', huh?

Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.

Make it time.

Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?

Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.

Sure.

Are you?

Do you love Drew?

When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

Yes?

Goodnight to you, Susan.

I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.

Then why are you here, Joe?

Watch me do what?

That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --

Yes.

Not now.

I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.

I don't know.

I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.

To bed.

It was everything.

I love you in an evening gown.

It's a saying.

Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?

I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.

'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?

Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.

What do you mean?

Of course.

Can you keep a secret?

I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.

I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?

'Fish'?

I'm sorry to hear that.

May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.

Yes?

I was just asking, Bill.

With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?

Get him in here.

Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --

'...Yes --'

Death!

You fill the bill, Bill.

Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?

Of course.

'Yes' is the answer to your question.

What you were talking about.

I'm here.

Time.

In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.

Yes, Bill.  The question.

Good morning, Quince.

You think Drew will go for it?

Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?

But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.

So what's wrong with that?

Don't get dirty, Dad --

I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.

You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.

I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.

Nothing.

Yer damn right.

Yeah, it's good to get together.

Joe?

I'm sorry.

Oh, yes --

Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.

I agree --

I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?

I think I know her.

No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.

I'm sorry... um... ?

I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.

Seen you together, that's all.

Hi, Leonard.

Leonard.

That's right I did, didn't I?

Interested in buying one?

Don't say anything else.

Yes.

But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.

Tell me about her again.

I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.

Where is he?

Yeah?

I told him about your car.

Somebody's come. Already.

Don't protect him.

Get rid of Dodd for me.

I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!

That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!

You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.

* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *

Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -

Thank you.

Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.

That's who you were, you don't know who you are.

John Gammell?

So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.

You don't have to remember to be hungry.

Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.

Probably left it in your room.

She's involved with these drug dealers.

So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.

I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.

There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!

That, and your thing.						   *

You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?

Are you sure?

You can't just take it!

Why would I have a gun?

His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *

Grieve elsewhere.

So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?

There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...

Recruit us to do what?

They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...

Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?

You said Nazi Low-riders...?

Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.

25% discount on the load.

Really?  So, what is this, a party?

You do.

Okay.

Havana.

Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.

Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...

I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...

Cost less.  That's the point.

What do you mean?

Zero risk.

I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...

Hola, viejo.

Do I need it?

This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.

I'll be on board by noon.

No.

Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.

'Cause she will tell you.

"No, viejo.  That was Jos Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."

Five minutes...

It's in the suburbs outside Havana.

Too fast.  Too many moving parts.

What's your Miami PD badge number?

Okay.  What's up?

NLR, we think.  I wanna know...

We don't know.

Sonny...?

I don't understand...

Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?

...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.

We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.

A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.

Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...

I had to lay eyes on you.

It is.  He try to take tonight's load?

Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...

Alonzo...

Said, a person's gotta make a living.

Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...

Lotta rich women back there...

Well, ain't no use hanging around here.

I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!

Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.

No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...

What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.

M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.

For money for what?

Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...

Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.

I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.

Whatsa matter now?

What's that supposed to mean?

So you could sleep! I mean Christ!

Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.

So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.

This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?

I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!

He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.

No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.

I'm wet.

Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.

Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?

Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.

This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...

You bet I do, sir.

Well, not too, I mean, a little.

Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?

Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.

...He had a bald skull and...

Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.

Stop shitting me, man!

Shit.

...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?

The Hilton.

About ten kilometers.

Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?

Beats working.

About as good as it looks.

He wasn't even in the car?

Yeah.

After we're outside the kogus?

I know where it is.

Yeah? Where?

My passport!

Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...

Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.

Mr. Yesil.

Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...

Yeah...?

...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...

No, you talkin' at me.

Oh, Jesus!!

Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?

Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.

Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!

Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...

Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!

Across both tracks!!

But it look like a man. It... I saw it.

Manny...

Okay. So you lost a great specimen-

Maybe they lied to you.

So?

No such thing, baby.

I was just late.

Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...

Toss the flare down!

They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!

The scent won't last...

You the bug lady, right?

She used a baster.

What is it?

No shit.

What?

I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.

I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...

Following me?

I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.

Nothing.

The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.

My daughter must be going nuts.

My pleasure.

She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...

Yeah, thanks.

Perfect.

Show me the way?

You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.

Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.

Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.

C'mere, I'll show you.

I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.

I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...

The what?

Why would you lose me?

It is.

No, I haven't.

Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?

Be my guest.

Maybe.

You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.

Dome Pear-igg-non it is.

Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.

He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.

Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?

No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?

I'm sure you're right.

We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.

Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.

It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.

Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.

Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.

How do you that.

Oh, I am.  Later..

Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.

Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...

To do what?

Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.

You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.

Why, you going to make me a better offer?

A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?

Right.

How much longer before you can reach him?

He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.

No.  Just as if I'd like to.

What if I pay the rent?

Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?

Indeed.

At least you walked.

Not really.  I triggered the alarm..

Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.

Ethan Hunt.

Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.

Which is?

This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.

Just like old times.

Just about..

Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --

Why?  What's happened. What did you see?

No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!

Why did you phrase it like that?

'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'

Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..

You were there.

In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.

Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.

Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.

Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.

You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.

I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.

In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.

That simple, huh?

Left jacket pocket?

No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.

You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.

Yes, Anatoly, yes.

So what do you suggest?

S.O.P..

And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.

May take a little time.

If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.

I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...

Take off your coat.

Take off your God damn coat!

No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!

I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.

Sure...

You didn't have to.........

Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?

Theyre dead.

One hour.

Yeah.

Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.

Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?

I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?

Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.

That depends.

Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

Like Job?

Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?

I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.

It doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.

Bank?

We're not outta here yet.

Just waiting for you, tubs.

Just don't chew it.

Higher.

Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.

Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.

If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.

What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.

Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.

He's our guy.

Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -

I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>

We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us.

What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.

Youre probably right.

And get a doctor.

Keep counting Claire.

Ethan - Ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.

I don't know.

Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.

Twenty minutes.

Connection denied.

Nobody. Loretta is getting married.

I'm going to bed now.

Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.

Bed.

Again?

I didn't give you away the first time.

What'd you do to your hair?

Alright. I didn't see you here.

And what did they say?

Let me come and talk to you.

Yes. Do you want...

Excuse me.

He knew my husband who died.

Yesterday.

You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?

All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.

I've never seen a moon like that.

Don't just become excited.

What did you do?

Marc Chagall. A Russian.

That's right.

Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 

No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?

You? No.

No?

My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.

I shouldn't.

Bobo, take the cart away.

This is a good suit.

My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.

Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.

In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.

And who's gonna pay for that?

No.

She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.

Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?

Where's pop?

No more he's not.

She recovered.

You gotta date?

What sins have you to confess?

I will. But I must find the right moment.

I came right from the airport.

She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.

Where is she?

You're kidding?

You don't know where Loretta is?

Definitely!

I'm not disturbed. By you.

None of your business.

I think it's because they fear death.

I'm too old for you.

Sure.

You mean the whole house?

You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.

You were a tiger last night.

And what do you burn, apart from witches?

Not at all.  They could be carried.

Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.

But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?

The Britons.

I am your king!

The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

We want ... a shrubbery!

We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!

Oh, please!

Had enough?

Course I have.

You'll what ... ?

Come, Patsy.

I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.

I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...

No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!

Just keep me covered.

It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!

Oh, just some friends!

There are some who call me Tim?

Greetings King Arthur.

How shall we find this cave, O Tim?

Who did we lose?

Man!

I'm thirty-seven.

Well ... I AM king.

Yes, I see.

Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.

Shut up!

Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of

If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

My name is Sir Launcelot.

What is your quest?

What is the capital of Assyria?

I think I could pull through, sir.

Farewell, Concorde!

You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!

Is it?

But, Mother ...

Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!

Well ... I'll tell you ...

... and you'll come and get him.

No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...

What?

Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...

Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!

Camelot ...

Why?

No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!

I don't think I was.

No, no, we must find the Grail.

You got my note!

I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...

No, no, no.

Not down south you don't.

It's better than shovelling horse shit.

Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?

You know what I mean.

The good-looking one.

I've got my duties to attend to.

Oh, I'm much more than that.

Mary Taylor, sir.

I hope to go up next year.

Mr Brown, sir --

Yeah, yeah, I did.

Yeah.

A situation?

I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!

Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.

And that is my last word on the matter.

How will I know?

That's not good enough.

You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.

She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.

I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.

I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --

I am a blank sheet.

Quite.

I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.

It's nothing.

I'm not married.

I do what I do.

Yes, ma'am.

I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.

I heard something.

Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.

I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

Yes?

I'm breaking no promises!

For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!

Then why send me back to them?!

Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.

You can't know that for sure.

Who?

Of course.

Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.

No, indeed.

Whom?

Cold is good!

Why am I being lectured in this way?!

I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....

I understand he was in a fight.

No.  I shall be out walking.

I have no idea.

I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.

Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?

Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.

You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.

Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.

How do you do that?

What the hell are you talking about?

Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.

It doesn't necessarily mean she's...

My house.  I want to try something.

Nick, what is it.

...but then it hits the relay stations...

No I'm not...

I can't believe you made it!

Screamer.

I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?

Give her a chance, will you?

I'm going home.

I'm going home Cynthia.

I'm going home. I'll call you later.

There is no problem.

I agree with what you said...truly.

I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.

That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.

Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.

It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...

Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?

No. I can't.

Oh...

But, this could be serious.

Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.

Good luck!

What is it? What do you see?!

Do you know them?!

Keep going. Go around to the back.

It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.

And who are we auditioning for today?

And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?

Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?

Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?

Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.

I just wanted to come here.

This Denny's.

Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.

Find out who they are?

Where at?

Damn, that's a long drive.

Making ends meet, huh.

Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.

Not a coke or anything?

Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?

What's going on ?

No time. Get him up.

Leave him, he's dead.

Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.

Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.

So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?

Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.

You don't. It's random, there no trick.

It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.

It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.

I work here, remember ?

43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.

I don't help criminals.

Let's just see if he can make it into round two....

Yes, sir Mom. 

You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !

Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?

Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.

That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.

Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?

Checking........

Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?

I am thirty two.

Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.

What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?

John, sir.

Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.

What are you looking for ? A blow job ?

Then what do you want ?

What ?????

I don't know.....

I have a turn for the worse for the team !

I can see that but where ?

Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?

Thank you.

Yes.

Yes, Excuse me for a second.

Which one, this door is locked !

We just having our first date when you showed up.

I'm fine.

Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.

Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??

I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.

Okay thanks, atta girl.

Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?

No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.

No it's okay, I understand, really.

Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.

Great.

Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.

Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!

Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.

Thanks, I needed that.

Hi Dad.

Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.

You're being narrow-minded.

Maybe he's hungry.

Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?

I'll try.

Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.

I've got something better.

Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?

Come on in!

It's just a corpse.

Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.

Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?

No-one invented gravity, it just exists.

Then I have come to the right place.

O.K. Thank you very much.

Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.

It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!

Just remember the needle in the haystack.

You would.

At least it gives you plenty of exercise.

Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.

What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???

In the tar??

Owh...

This is a totally barbaric custom.

And you'd be my cousin?

Good. I mean...

I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.

I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.

Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?

Rose this not the place to be having this...

They're great.

Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.

That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?

Committed.

This is it I guess.

Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.

You know how I feel about you.

Bye Niece, Vada.

I'm a pediatric cardiologist.

Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.

Yes, I do.

Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.

Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.

This is one of my favorite things, her passport.

No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.

You have no idea.

O.K.

Vada!!

I like to buy off all the railroads.

No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?

My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.

Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.

Pardon?

Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.

I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.

I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.

Why d'you think these seats were empty.

Did she ever see Vada?

Goodnight.

Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

Is it really your camper?

Pointing upwards Look...

Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.

They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.

Then who's it for?

What?

No, sweetie, not yet.

Feeding my fish.

He was allergic to bees.

What??

Are you sure about all this?

No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?

Hi, is Vada home?

Thank you. Bye.

It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.

Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.

I wrote a poem too.

Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.

Yes it is.

It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

Well you don't know that. Ask him.

Can I use your bathroom first?

Come here, sit down.

Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.

What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?

Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

Uh huh.

No.

What?

No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.

What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.

I told you i'll get in trouble.

I am not.

I stopped that!

We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.

Go???

I wanna live with them too.

Really?

Hi Vada, can you come out?

Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?

Like they do on TV?

Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.

But then I won't be able to see anything.

Umm, Ummmmm

Well, then, I'll take it up with her.

Part of being a New Yorker.

... weeks.

Kindred spirits.

He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...

I have a suggestion...

You have a real philosophy of life.

I can see why.

Chill?  Since when do you say ch...

The man you love.

I wish.

Try less appropriate.

I can't even say it.

What do you suggest?

It's too late to start over.

Major.  Dish.

Oh, you're more than okay.

Well, we're...

I can be quick.  I can even be funny.

... you hate weddings, you never go.

... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...

... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...

... that this is all my fault?

Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...

Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??

Hate that.

She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.

Firenze.

Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?

Boy, those were the days.

Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...

Like I said, dazzling.

Well, you've got the rest of your lives.

Have you.

We danced to it.  Just like this.

Well.

Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.

It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.

You're right.  Easy come, easy go.

"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."

A bad combination.

Shhh.

I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...

The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.

I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...

... and you knew about this.

What is that sup...

Right here.

Well, that just happened that time.

You got a real good memory, Star.

Grand Old Opera --

I won first prize.

Yes. I'm cutting a record.

What?

You're so good.

I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.

Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.

I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.

You get her those Vitamin E right away.

Okay. Thanks.

Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?

Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.

He knows better.

They can come to the concert in the park.

Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.

Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.

Who the hell is he?

What does he want?

I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.

Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.

Sure thing.

Okay.

When is it?

Not yet.

Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?

What is a turkey shoot.

Your wire Ester - she passed away.

Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.

A little. What do you need?

Replacement party.

A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.

I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.

No.

Nash.

How are you going to pay when you get sick?

He doesn1t have fungus, does he?

I've been a Little dyspeptic.

When I was little, in church.

No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.

He's a member of our congregation.

What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.

Who is this, right?  I called you last night.

I have to go.

Oh.

Oh.

Oh.

What...?  0h, yes.

Yea.

I'm sorry but I have to go.

Eight-thirty in the chapel.

Hundreds of times.

Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.

You're doing some recording here, aren't you?

Mary?

Do they have a show to give it to you?

Do you study at all?

Where is she?

We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?

I never heard of him. Name somebody else.

I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?

I'll be dammed.

Sure thing.

More or less...

Yes you are.

Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

What...

How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.

Are we in a big hurry?

Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.

What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.

Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.

Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.

Tough titty, it's mine now.

Good...yuppie piece of shit.

Have you talked to Mallory about this?

Don't worry about it.

No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?

Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?

You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?

It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.

Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...

No.

Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.

Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...

Yes.

No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

No fuckin' way!

Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.

Unfortunately, yes.

Yes.

Survival of the fittest.

Capt'n!

That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.

So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?

Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

Perfecto!

Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.

Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.

Lose 'em.

Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.

Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?

Don't call my men assholes.

They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.

Out.

That'll be thirty-eight cents.

That's right.

What d'you think?

You' new here, man!  See you, boys.

What did you say your name is?

I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.

Oh yeah? That's good.

Yeah. On the section gang.

Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.

No.

That's right.

Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.

You almost got into trouble back there.

No. Women're always followin' me 'round.

I thought you wasn't comin'.

It'll be fine when we get done with it.

Don't call them that.

He could live with us.

Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!

My father's never done a thing for any of them.

You jivin' me?

We'll be all right.

What about your boy?

Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?

Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?

What the hell could you do?

'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.

I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.

Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.

When I get set, I'll send for you.

Like what?

You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!

Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.

Sorry.

Don't do her no good to go into a tree.

I said, she's in great shape.

Whenever he's got an edge on.

Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.

That's right.

Okay.

Don't look like there's a right way.

Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.

Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?

Hi.

Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?

What's the matter?! It's a celebration!

Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?

Okay, boy, beat it.

Anything you say, baby.

You hate Raoul?

Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...

I'm still on my honeymoon.

I'm fine.

Of course.

He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.

Of course...

The Elders, mon...

A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.

They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.

How's the villa's security?

You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.

Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.

First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.

Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.

The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.

This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.

It hasn't yet.

I've arranged for him to work with us.

I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?

You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.

What about McCoy?

Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.

You'll be linked during the entire operation.

This ain't Bangkok, chief.

The words?

I don't have a girl.

That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?

Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?

Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.

I an' I, man. I an' I.

Can you walk?

No problem, amigo.

When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.

That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.

So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.

No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.

I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.

Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.

No!... No...

People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.

Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.

I don't know. I don't know...

I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.

Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.

What's my end?

For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.

Too late?

Put the gun down, Case.

Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.

Something exotic I hope.

No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.

I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.

Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.

Nice.

Oh I know.

Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.

Thanks.

Yeah, I know.

Exactly.

Right. 7:30.

Nope.

I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?

And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?

Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.

No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.

It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.

We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"

Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.

Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.

Betty.

It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.

Five-- Six--

Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.

You're a sick puppy, Geller.

Oh. Right.

Kristen got a quote?

No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.

You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.

Dude, you rock!

You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.

Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.

I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.

Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.

No. Josie, this is real.

With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.

Really?

Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."

College. Haven't really thought about it.

Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.

I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.

You remember that story?

Why do you do that?

I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.

That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--

What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--

It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?

Yeah, I have.

You were attracted to me?

Wait, I was going to tell you--

I finally found my story.

The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.

Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.

Well, a ball player.

Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.

Everybody knows about--

And heavy...

Where?

He stayed a long time.

<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>

<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>

<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>

It's getting there.

Oh, come on Dad...

What are you talking about?

What about it?

She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.

You got a problem with me, Grady?

Yeah, why?

What the hell are you talking about?

It was okay.

Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.

He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...

Look at this car.  Are you kidding?

Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.

Yeah.

Wow...

I don't know.  Where are we going?

What's this?

My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.

Why won't you talk to me?

I can't!

Sure...go ahead.

How'd you sleep, honey, okay?

All of them.

We're going to bed.

Hi Mom.

It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.

They're healing up nicely.

Research.

No, she's right.

When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?

I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.

You did it the other night.

Those are ancient history.

Fuck off.

Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.

Sounds like a rough time.

I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?

That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?

With Hypnocyl?

Everybody take five.

Anything?

All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.

Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.

Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.

That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --

You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.

Don't worry, it won't come to that.

Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.

There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.

For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.

Uh, fourteen.

Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...

Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.

I'm a vegetarian.

Night, night, Honey.

Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?

Fifteen million dollars.

Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.

No thanks.

You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.

Oh -- Okay.

Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.

Yes.

You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?

I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.

It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.

She left me.

There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.

Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.

Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?

Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.

Oh no no -- no.

I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?

My son's name is Johnny?

Well, get a message through to him too.

No.  What's that?

You have a stunt bottom?

Don't ask.

I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...

I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.

That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.

I only found out you were here yesterday.

Thank you.  Shall I...

What's the thing?

And what would you say...

That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.

Yes.

C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.

Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.

Tony -- what do you think?

No -- it's my 22nd.

Di Caprio.

Well, yes.  Groovy.

William has just turned down Anna Scott.

Well, thanks, that's great.

Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.

Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?

Still, not sparkling.

Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...

And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.

I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.

Ah... yes, enormously.

But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.

Can I help you?

Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?

Can you tell her I'll ring her back.

No -- did you?

She's perfect, perfect.

Is it someone we know?

But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.

I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.

Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.

Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...

Two?  That's it?

Absolutely not.

Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?

Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?

Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.

Right -- let's talk about rent...

Yes, that's perfectly correct.

Yes, that is correct.

I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...

Y-y-y-yes...

I-I-I...

You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!

Who? Tell me!

Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.

I wanna report a robbery!

Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!

Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?

Right!

Go on...

He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!

Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.

B-B-Billy.

O-o-o-oh...

W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?

Go ahead! Go back!

M-M-M-Mack?

Are they all crazies?

Wow! They're so quiet.

It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.

Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.

What for?

Hey, what's that?

Tell 'er to go straight to hell!

My feet hurt...

A pecking party?

Lobotomy?

Now, what would I be trying to say?

Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!

What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!

No!

I'm not running a charity ward...

What's he talkin' about?

McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...

Gary Blinker...

Hold it a minute.

Yeah, Mac?

Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.

I see.

Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.

Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.

'Kay, Mac!

'Kay!

I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.

I'm the next one.

Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!

Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!

Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?

Sure...

Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...

Okay. Who else?

'Kay...

Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...

You an' me, Chief.

No...

Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?

On what?

Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.

I don't have any.

This way, Mister McMurphy.

After you, ma'am.

Now you talkin'.

Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.

Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...

Are they dangerous when they're awake?

That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.

Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!

No, she wasn't my sister.

I-- I must've misplaced it.

Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?

I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?

Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.

Why?

My friend has lost her fucking mind...

Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.

No.

It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.

Exactly.

Except possibly that.

No.

But, Faith--

Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.

I'm at the airport.  Why?

Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.

I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.

NO.

He's safe.

Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?

Because.  I know where he is.

Because-- I want you to be happy.

Mickey Spillane?

Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.

Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.

Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.

No.  I just came by to apologize.

In that case... no...

You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.

That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?

There is no us.

Tonight?

A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--

Yeah.  He's around somewhere.

You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.

It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.

So?...

Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.

It's a coincidence.

What about your job?

You're coming with me?

Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?

"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?

You and the other 99% of the women in the world.

Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.

Only what?

What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?

Nothing.

Her brother.

I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.

Because I'm the one who's single.

Packing.

Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.

I know, but...

He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.

Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.

No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.

What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...

I thank you.

Right.

You used to love it when I called you doll.

If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.

Gimme.

Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.

That was the idea.

He probably gave 'em an argument.

Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.

I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.

You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.

Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.

Maybe.

Don't say that!

What do you weigh these days, slugger?

Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.

I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.

Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.

I wish I knew, Edie, But 

Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.

A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.

Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.

In a saloon?

I am?

I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.

Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.

Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.

You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.

I know... I know... .

Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.

Get away from me.

I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.

I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?

Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.

You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .

You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.

He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .

He wanted to see me again.

And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.

Someone else c'n take your confession.

I don't want to hear it in there.

A question of who rides who.

Good luck.

Why don't you go and chase yourself?

A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.

Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.

Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!

Are you on the level, Father?

If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?

Down to the wire?

Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.

Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.

If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.

Raise a hand to me and... .

Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.

Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .

First things first.

Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 

By way of Chicago?

It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.

I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.

I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 

What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?

Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.

..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.

You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.

Okay.

I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.

I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!

I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.

Be careful!

I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.

I should hope not.  I hate you!

My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.

A symbol, Master.

It would seem so, Master.

Ahh, there is yet time.

You mean...!

Is there time?

Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.

Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--

Who is it?

From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.

I know a Glenn.

You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.

He didn't want me to.

He'd call every once in a while.

Who are you?

Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

She's coming with us.

Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...

There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.

What's he do now, tell fortunes?

Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.

Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?

They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?

Yes, she did.

Yeah, I did.

Half for doing what?

They sure do.

And then they'll kill 'em.

All you gotta do is get in.

Jack --

In the trunk, yeah?

When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.

And what happened to Carl?

What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.

Call and tell you.

Wait.  You not Adele?

Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.

I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.

Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.

Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.

I don't smoke.

Not until recently.

For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.

In my bag, in the car.

You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.

What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.

I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?

Faye Dunaway.

Peter Finch.

Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?

He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.

Those guys bother you?

Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.

Yeah, but in a nice way.

You believe that?

Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.

I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.

I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.

I see better with them on.

You're in civilization now, man, ease up.

You know who they are?

I don't know.  I never used a gun.

You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.

Of course not.

What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?

A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.

I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.

Yeah.  That was the ninth.

Hejira.

Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?

Glenn?

We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.

Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?

Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.

You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.

No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

I <i>was</i>...

He said he stayed with Maurice.

Your dog was killed?

Oh, he's moved out?

What're you doing at Glades?

No?

He's pretty laid back, confident.

It's possible.  Why?

That's right, just me.

No.  Course not.

Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.

Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

He was that good?

You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.

Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!

Sir, I --

The one that slept in my mouth last night.

Well, you p-puked on his feet.

Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.

Power dive!

Good shooting, Rafe!

The Colonel helped me work it out.

Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.

Yeah.

It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.

So what are you saying?

You left her.  How's that for a fact?

Fuck you.

Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.

Little less.

Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?

No.  You're trying to beat me.

They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.

The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.

He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.

I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?

Thank you, Sir.

Bombers.

Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.

We're all going away.

Why were you sitting here, instead of...

Brilliant, Admiral.

We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.

Have the planes made it to China?

Peggy Sue!

I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?

Goodbye, Grandma.

Stag movies. Smokers.

It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.

We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.

It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.

Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.

That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.

Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.

It's that jerk Walter.

Charlie...

Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.

I'm not going.

Charlie! Am I dead?

Maybe I blocked it out.

Why wait?

Is this slow enough for you?

You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.

And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?

That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!

How'd you know about that?

That's real big of you.

You're going to listen to me.

Right here. Now sit down.

How could you possibly know what I've been going through?

Of course.

Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?

I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.

Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.

Touchy, touchy!

What, why?

That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.

I wish she hadn't.

It must run in the family.

Come on, where's your enthusiasm?

But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.

They care about you. They're just a different generation.

Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.

Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.

Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?

I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.

Doing some shopping?

This morning was good.

That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.

Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.

Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.

Of course, dear. You're home now.

Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.

What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.

What about?

It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?

It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.

For what?

You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.

Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?

Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.

You have an incredible memory.

But accidents can happen.

I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.

Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.

Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.

I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?

This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.

I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!

I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.

That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?

Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...

Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.

God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!

Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.

He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...

I'll be fine, Dad.

Anywhere but here.

Zowie.

You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.

Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?

Yeah...

Maybe it takes a while...

Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?

I said, don't worry about it.

He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?

I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."

Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.

Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.

The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.

That's not what I said.

That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.

I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.

More than your friend. Family.

Don't do this, Andy.

I'm seeing him this afternoon.

About my blood work?

Sounds delightful.

Defined by Webster's as harmless.

It's okay. Can I sit down?

As in, the vegetable?

Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?

What?

Rayisha. Very nice.

One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.

What happens?

I suppose you could say that.

You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...

I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.

Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.

What?

You bet. We'll see you later.

Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.

In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.

That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.

As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?

One. Here, in front of my ear.

Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.

All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.

Objection.

Is that a question?

Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.

Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...

I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?

I'm not worried. What are you doing?

Right.

Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.

Not especially.

Who?

Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!

Yeah... ?

Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.

Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?

Any women on board?

How did you do that?

Yes, we did.

Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.

You had one guy "like that?"

Helloooo...

Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"

... It's time to get this society back on track!

It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....

No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.

Show me your eyes.

They're coming.

I got the quick-and-ugly version.

Saw something I didn't like.

Get out of our way.

Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.

Can we switch?

During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.

Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.

Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.

Let's wait on the power cells.

He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.

I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.

I never said I was.

Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.

For your own fear.

What the hell's it matter?

We're just burnin' light here.

-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

What, you're goin' off, too?

Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

Company's not here, is it?

Rain.

There is no "safe."

Which half?

Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.

Not staying in here another....

Say that again.

For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?

I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

Looks clear.

No. She's not.

Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.

What do you care?

Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?

You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?

Do you have any weapons?

Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?

Good luck then.

What's so special about him?

Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.

And they fell out of the sky with you?

That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.

Yo!

That way.

What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.

The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.

Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?

Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.

See? He keeps pretending he can talk.

He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.

Forget it. Abandon ship.

We're here to stay.

You don't seem very cut up about it.

long pause) You know it.

Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.

Climb off me, will you!

Let's take a look.

Okay.

You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.

What is it?

I think you're making a mistake.

What?

Keep moving. We can't turn back now.

Why special?

My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.

This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...

Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!

By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.

Mind your tongue, madame.

Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?

Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.

All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?

Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.

All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.

Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?

We can't.

All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!

God bless you.

Like you, I find it difficult.

I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!

KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!

How the hell did he get away?

Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.

Yeah, what is it?

Fuck you bitch.

Yeah if you let me have your shirt.

Shaddup bitch.

Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.

Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.

Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!

Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.

I got one...

Over here!

Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.

Barnes believes in what he's doing.

In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...

Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.

Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.

Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.

He dugged his own grave.

Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!

Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...

I don't want to hear about it Jackson.

Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.

Well..

I really don't know.

I'm supposing.

I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.

I'm sure you have.

I haven't been invited.

Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.

Would you mind?

Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.

Immigration Officer?

Possibly, Miss.

I see.

He got in here how?

Bad enough.

Quarter after one. Why?

Is this the best you can do?

I didn't notice him.

Absolutely sure.

I know.  Killaine has a warrant.

Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.

That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?

How bad is the other thing?  The secret?

But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?

That, and the fun of it.

And I'm begging for my life--and yours.

Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--

I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.

Beer?  Well, all right.

Ale. I don't mind.

Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.

I've never been to Florida.

We wouldn't have met at all.

You were there when I last saw him.

You--or the Vancouver Police Department?

You understand perfectly.

I don't want to talk.

I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.

Very ridiculous.

You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.

I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.

Who's Goble?

Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.

If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.

For two hundred?

A thousand.

In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.

Sometimes.

Leave that one lay.

The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.

I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.

How's life treating you?

No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?

Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.

I wouldn't know.

That must hurt.

Would that make me a heel?

Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.

Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?

Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.

I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.

What?

You don't throw guests out, Brandon.

Mr. Mitchell.

I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.

Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.

See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.

They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.

How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.

Floater?

Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.

I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 

Would you?

Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?

The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?

Talk English.  How do I know you're you?

I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".

Maybe we've been pretty dumb--

If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.

Did we ever really think it was suicide?

Warm water, no doubt.

I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?

Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.

I'm interested in who handled it.

That leaves two strangers.

The card says so, doesn't it?

I hear she's a very pretty girl.

Aye.  You have a point there.

A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.

Who's the girl?

You ought to know why.

Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.

What does it look like?

You already have the checks, darling.

A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?

It's kind of you to see me.

What a shame.

Yes.

Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.

To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.

Yes.

That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?

She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.

No thanks.  I'd like to break away--

Thank you.

That's her.

I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.

Too bad.  What did your father do?

And you're at this third stage

You just might.

Let me see.

Yes, finally.

Suez.  1956.

Take a look at these.

The bed's all made up if you want to stay.

She said that?

And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?

In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.

Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.

Not yet.

No, Bells Beach, Australia.

Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.

My man!

You do it... you first!

Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.

And let my policy expire?  Sorry.

What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.

No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!

I asked them to give me a couple minutes...

Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.

Yes, sir.

Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

What that?

Punk.  Quarterback Punk.

Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.

Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.

The fucking punks are surfers.

Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.

Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.

Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.

He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.

Angelo, we gotta talk.

Did he rob it?

Yeah, or cashing a check.

Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.

Shrimp and fries.

I'm serious.

No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--

He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.

We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.

What?

I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.

Warm them up.

Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!

Who cares!

Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.

Anytime.

What's that, General?

There's no sign of it.

You're not getting any navy contracts.

But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.

No.

I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.

I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.

You what?

How?

If you can figure it out, be my guest.

You're not from L.A., huh?

Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.

You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.

I never joke about money.

Can I have some chips?

Do you plan everything?

Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.

Why?

Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.

Just a romantic, that's you.

If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.

"Occupational hazard".

There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.

Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.

Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?

I thought I told you not to answer the phone.

Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.

Television?

Thank you.  I would.  Nice.

I think it's exciting.

Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.

Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.

Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.

Shush.  Of course you can.

You won't.

Where are you taking me!?

Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?

I more than liked it.

Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.

It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.

Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.

It was good.

I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.

Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --

Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?

Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.

Goodbye, Bill.

Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --

Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.

Rent.  You're late.

Of rent I do not bullshit.

What?

You're a guest here?

Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.

Excuse me?

I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.

'Scume me.

Do you remember me?

I just might do that.

Then I'm here till I die?

I do not marry tonight.

I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.

"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.

I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.

Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?

You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!

I will never doubt again.

You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.

Gently!!

What hideous sin have you committed lately?

I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.

Anybody want a peanut?

Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.

I'm waiting!

-- what? --

-- where?

The body?

What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.

We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?

I don't be-leeve this.

The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.

Because I can stop now if you want.

All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.

As you wish...

The gate has but one key, and I carry that.

DEATH FIRST!!

I swear it will be done.

Of course.

Yes.

Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.

That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.

-- offer me money --

-- offer me everything I ask for --

I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!

That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

Again. Thank you.

More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.

You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.

Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.

You're sure nobody's following us?

You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.

I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.

Morons.

For the Princess?

I smell nothing.

You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.

An hour.

A little bit.

He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

"Honeymoon,

Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.

Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?

Where?  What?

Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...

Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.

You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.

Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.

But what if the play was a hit?

What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.

Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.

It's a little better, but you still look angry.

Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.

Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?

Right.

I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.

Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.

I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.

Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.

No way out.  No way out.

No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?

I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.

What???

What is it?

He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 

Yes.

With whom?

Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.

You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.

You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?

All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.

Got dag pa dig.

Nice girl.

We can't play today?

Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.

Wagner...

Hindenburg...

The Graf Spee...

Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.

"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "

Vat?

Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

What have you done, LSD?

I told them we invaded England.

In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.

She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...

Tell me all about her.

Of which morning?

No one met her?

You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?

Someone is sitting in that window.

If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?

Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?

No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...

Who are you, friend?

Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...

I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...

You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!

Now. Your sister is missing how long?

How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?

And the police haven't been able to...

With the forty thousand dollars?

Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!

Just what he told your detective.

May I talk to you?

Lila.

With you.

To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?

Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...

You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.

How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...

I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.

First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.

You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.

Yes.

Sam! Why call when we can go?

Just wait here?

Does that mean we can't...

Of course we will.

We were going to get married. Are going to get married!

Watch your tenses.

Hospital clean.

The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!

Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

I could stand something regular.

What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?

Sam!

This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.

It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...

We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!

Sam, let's go get married.

You have a vacancy?

I thought I'd gotten off the main...

Los Angeles.

It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 

Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?

Oh I do... but I say I don't. 

To a private island, like you?

I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.

I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.

Very early. Dawn.

Then I'm free to go...?

I'm sorry.

Why?

Maybe you saw Mary!

At this hour?

You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...

Arbogast.

It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

Haven't any.

That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?

I didn't think so.

Left Phoenix under her own steam?

Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?

Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.

Did I?

What--special autopsy?

[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?

Indeed, he has often told me.

I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.

Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.

I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.

Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.

How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?

Take him to the psychopathic hospital.

Maybe you're right.

Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.

You found Buckley?

Oh, Maxwell? He's left.

Do you have many patients, doctor?

Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.

No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.

I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?

I'll have it for supper.  So long.

Delighted, I'm sure. 

What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.

I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.

It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.

And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.

Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.

You mean he was colored?

Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.

What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!

All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 

Get out of here.

I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.

No kiddin'. What's your idea?

About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?

Almost certain.

Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.

Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...

It's all yours.

Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.

Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?

For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --

They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.

Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?

I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.

No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 

You go in for dangerous things.

I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.

Don't ask any questions. Come on!

You're insane.

That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.

He can't hear you.

Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.

Thanks.

That's the physicist's playground.

It's an experiment.

What universe are you in, Paul?

That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --

Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.

But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.

I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.

What terrible thing in Cave Springs?

But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?

What did you expect?

Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.

Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.

You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.

That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.

Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.

Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...

Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.

But why, if I'm not hurting you?

No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!

Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.

Rose, you are too uncritical of people.

Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.

You won't die, Rose.

I don't want to know...

She's getting herself up to go out.

Yeah.

Is that all?

Buddy, that was my place.

Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.

Hello, Daddy. How are you?

Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?

Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.

No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?

She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.

It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,

Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.

I think we both know her.

Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.

Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.

But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.

I don't care where the polecat studied.

She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.

No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.

Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!

Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?

That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?

Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.

All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?

Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!

Well, it has buttons.

My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.

Oh, anywhere downtown.

Yes, sir.

Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!

Oh, no, sir.

I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.

Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!

He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.

What's the use, there ain't none.

Tennessee?

What?

All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?

Page proof of a book I'm working on.

Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.

That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.

That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.

Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?

Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?

She looks terrible, just awful.

It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.

Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.

Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.

Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.

Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?

Yes, Ma'am.

Doll, you and Waski run on, too.

I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...

I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.

I don't mind.

Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.

I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.

... okay... you made your point.

I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.

Now you know what to watch for...

Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...

Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.

Alright!  Alright... put me down...

It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.

Thank you, concerned citizen.

I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.

Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.

We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.

No you can't.

Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.

Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?

Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.

No, but it should.

You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.

We have to find Kittle.

Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.

Can't you say something nice once?

I'm waiting till the time's right.

No.

We've got the tape to prove it.

It's our job.

"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."

First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...

Let's hope.

Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...

He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.

Gimmie a minute.

A.D. is a C.P.A.

I'm well aware of that.

That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.

You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

Yoda will always be with you.

You cannot escape your destiny.

I can't kill my own father.

I can't see.

You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.

A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

Hi, Han... Chewie.

It'll work. It'll work.

It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

Charges!  Come on, come on!

Here's the terminal.

No, wait! I thought you were blind!

Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

Quiet.

Just...images, really. Feelings.

She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?

You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

But, why must you confront him?

I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.

I will not fight you, father.

I will not fight you.

Never-r-r!

I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

I told you, my car broke down.

Janet.

For you.

Dammit, Janet.

Yes.

Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?

We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.

Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?

You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.

Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.

Makes you cry

Makes you cry

Oh my, my,

That ain't no crime

Oh no no no no.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.

No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...

...Fine.

...I'm sorry.

Absolutely.

Ohh!

By accident?

My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'

...I suppose.

Morning after?

...No thanks.

Yes, I do.

It's fine.

I should leave.

Do me another favor?

Don't tease me.

Don't want weak legs.

Yeah... Threw my whole day off.

...What?

...What?

What're we going to do?

Paul.

It's not your house --

I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!

You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!

You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!

Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!

Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?

Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.

Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --

He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.

Don't like yours neither.

Move your shoulders down.

No dollar.

Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --

This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.

Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.

Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.

Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.

...Fine.

I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.

Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?

Rocky.

Sparrin'?

Stuff it, man!

I won't.

Yeah.

Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.

You think everybody I fight is a bum.

Freak luck for sure.

Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.

Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.

Yo, Benny.

'Bout what?

Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!

Forget her. You could do better than my sister.

My sister's a friggin' loser.

Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.

Gazzo's gotta come to you.

Try again, c'mon, try again.

Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.

...No.

Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.

Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.

Feel? I dunno... Happy.

You serve martinis, doncha?

C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?

So where is it then?

Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?

He's a Toon... who cares?

Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

Toon cops worked me over.

Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.

It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?

Why didn't you tell me?

When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.

Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.

Doom.

So's the job.

As soon as is humanly possible.

Sure, Valiant, sure...

Valiant?  What're you doin' here?

Take it easy.

Aah!

Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.

My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.

I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.

Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!

I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.

A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.

My brother.  Get inside.

Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?

That's why I'll be there at 8:45.

I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.

Good idea.

From this box here...

I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.

The what?

Good-morrow, cousin.

Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.

But 'tis no wit to go.

Art thou hurt?

Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!

If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!

The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.

She'll not come down tonight.

Madam, in happy time what day is that?

What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!

I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!

Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,

Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife

Amen

Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?

Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!

More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.

I dream'd a dream to-night.

Well, what was yours?

Thou hast most kindly hit it.

Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

I am for you.

Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.

Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?

So where do you go from here?

Which leads us to...

Best beer in the world known to man or God.

It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.

No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.

Is that right?

I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...

Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.

Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.

There's a problem...

I'll destroy whatever's in the case.

But you hate each other!

A post office box.

Much to your disappointment, no doubt.

I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!

That's it.

Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.

I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.

Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.

Why don't you go do better, then...

I blast the lead car into oblivion...

I don't think so.

No thanks.

To see a man about a thing.

That's what I thought.

Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.

I just wanted to see something.

I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...

Know what?

But you can't.

It's my job.

Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.

If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.

Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.

Finish the job...

You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.

I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.

It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.

Why didn't you kill him?

Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.

I get the picture.

I can't get enough of it.

Sure thing, and --

The horniest dog in Nevada.

Maybe.  Who cares?

What's that?

He saw everything!

Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.

Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.

Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...

All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.

Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.

No.

Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!

It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?

Two thousand...

Just take it in stride.

You better believe it if you know what's good for you!

Hello.

He's irresponsible.

I might have to look into that...

Nothing.

You deserve it is the occasion.

Nothing happened?

There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.

It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.

I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.

I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...

I don't know.  My friends...

I don't believe it.

You know I do.

A week ago, at most.

Yeah.

You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?

First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.

Don't worry the real men are in charge now.

Excellent. I'll go down with you.

Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.

Did you say After Midnight?

So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!

Well I just uh, you know...

Anything...specific?

Hmmm...

Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.

Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.

Take it or leave it.

Sort of.

I can't hear a word you're saying!

And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?

So I want the money and I want it now.

We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.

Absolutely positively.

So someone did get away.

No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?

We're going to find out.

No, sir.

How much is that?

I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.

What??  Where'd you hear that?

You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.

I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?

One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.

Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.

I don't think so.

I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.

So what's your story?

In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.

Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.

No.

Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?

Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!

Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.

You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.

How you doin'?

Don't look at my ass!

Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.

Who?

I'm okay, you go.

I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.

No.  She's a school teacher.

Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.

Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.

He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.

How do you know?

I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?

Excuse me?

Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.

What's going on?

Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.

Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...

Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.

What?

It's a bomb.

We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.

Mind your own business.

There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.

Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.

Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?

I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?

A Chinese man discovered electricity.

Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.

What?!?!

Carter...

About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.

This money is evidence.

The Plaza Hotel?

Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --

Just trying to make it look real.

How do I know I can trust you?

No.  But I'll help you.

The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?

Any leads?

The police can protect you.

Put the plates down.  It's over.

Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.

I know, Master, but...

Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --

This is still Hong Kong.

Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!

I know, but --

Carter.

Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.

I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.

I am not responsible for your assumptions.

What?

Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.

Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?

Stooly.

Yes, I think so.

Yee-aww.

Good God, ya'll!

I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.

No, fish is a PM food.

It's him.

I am from outa town.

What?

You know him?

Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.

That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!

At this point we don't have much.

Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.

Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?

Nobody touches me.

Do it!

How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!

You don't. He finds you. Through his people.

You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.

I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...

Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.

Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.

Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."

Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.

How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?

Thank you.

I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.

I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?

Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.

I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.

What?

Where do you think she's going?

Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.

Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

Unbelievable, she got to you.

Are you a reporter?

No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.

Betty Trout.  Five dollars.

-- The luau for Maggie.

You'll answer my questions?

But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.

He is not!

Seven-fifty.

So?  Is that what you said to her?

You don't know.

Can you fix it?

Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.

What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?

Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.

I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.

Well, you do have the dress.

I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!

It's something I've always wanted to do.

I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?

"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".

It's probably because you got him fired.

On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?

No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.

No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.

I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.

No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".

Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.

Yeah.

-- who's married to --

-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --

I love you.

Nope.  Not even when I was young.

How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.

And then I'll see you in New York --

You couldn't.

Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?

There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --

Nothing's with me.

Not.

"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --

I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?

Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.

You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.

You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.

Is this crazy?

Good night.

He said hello.

I saw her.  She looked just like this --

Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.

So I mailed your letter.

Okay.

So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --

A sense of humor.

Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.

I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.

Yes, I did.

We'll move them --

Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?

What?

Magic.

Mom, we already...

Magic.

Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.

I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.

Have you had any relationship since?

What's she talking about?

It's not that late in Seattle.

Yeah.

How about rapacious and love- starved?

Right, right.

Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?

I don't think I have to now.

Nobody else is going to know it was us.

I forgot to mention.  Jed called --

Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.

It doesn't.  They ask you.

What do you think?

What was?

You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.

There she is.

No.

I just called for a second.

I can't know what I said, but we're not going.

You must be Jonah.

He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.

I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.

Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?

So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.

I read the same article...

Why didn't you give a warning signal?

There's nothing stopping you.

Whose side are you on anyway?

What do you mean -- sex equality?

So much the better.

He will if he wants us to go on blasting.

Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.

No. No. I can't. If Ramn ever found me on a picket line ...

Don't you worry. We'll get some action.

What's more important than sanitation?

I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.

All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...

If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...

Antonio paid for it.

I did forget. Lus told me.

It's nothing. Just a little catch ...

He was born fighting. And born hungry.

Yes.

I'm going back tomorrow.

Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.

I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.

Hunting.

Sun up.

Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.

You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?

Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?

Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?

New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?

I thought maybe you forgot...

She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.

The what!

You should have helped her without being asked.

You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...

Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.

Shhh.

Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

How about in the house?

I understand. Thanks anyway.

I was thinking Alice Cooper.

Leave me out of this.

Colette ...

Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?

There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.

Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.

Don't worry. He's out of town.

I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?

You don't like the tune, find another station.

Therapy session is over.

Please open the door, Danny.

What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.

They would have killed you too.

I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.

Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.

It's not too late to show her you're sorry.

Guess it's our turn.

I know a guy.

Sorry.

You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.

Can you set that up?

I think on account of his nose.

He doesn't have one.

John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.

It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?

I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.

I can't tell you.

I'm sorry. I couldn't.

You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.

Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.

Crank or glass?

Make me an offer.

I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.

Hey, okay.

Pull your pants down.

What?!

What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?

Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.

This chink have a name?

Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.

News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.

What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?

I'm afraid so, Danny.

My name is Tom.

It speaks!

To who?

And what does this have to do with me?

What?!

Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?

And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.

Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.

Several possession charges, but nothing major.

They have. But they never found a lab.

What if he caps me before you can make a move?

I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.

Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?

Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.

What do you mean?

That's not good in prison. It's just not good.

Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.

Don't worry about it.

I thought you were done.

Where are your men now?

I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.

There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.

He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.

Spit it out, Captain.

Thank you, sir.

No kidding.

You must be a hell a shot.

You got somethin' against the Cap'n?

Nope, he ain't Wade.

Like hell, you did.

In the shadow by those two trees.

Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.

You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?

Good, now get your goddamned gear.

That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.

Plenty.

You don't count.

Those guns are close.

But, sir...

Maybe.

Since when have things been normal?

They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.

How about I go right, sir?

More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...

Let's just find someplace.

Bits and pieces.

It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.

Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.

I think you're right, Keith.

We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.

Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.

Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.

No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?

Sure, Reiben.

Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.

You have orders, too.

Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.

I don't like that one.

But we accomplish the mission.

ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.

See to it.

I coach the baseball team, too.

FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.

Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.

As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.

I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?

We know.

He's fast, Captain, I saw him.

Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...

Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!

Twenty-four-five.

We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.

And your former wife.

For going to school?

Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?

C'mon Lloyd.

Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.

Read it.

Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.

If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?

Alright.

Everybody thinks I'm a priss.

We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.

Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.

Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.

You're going.

Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.

Swear to god, I need to know the truth.

I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.

No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.

Hi.

Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.

You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?

Alright.

Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.

Yeah?

Yeah.

No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.

Eight.

Goodbye.

No.

Yeah.

I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.

They knew of you.  Now they know you.

Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?

Twisted?

I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.

Come on.

Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,

What did you say?

Friends with potential.

Right.

Oh.  I was putting the...

Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.

Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.

No, we don't have to say it.

No, I don't, I don't.

Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.

No I didn't.

You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.

Oh shit.

Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.

I love you.

Okay, good, this is all very noble.

So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.

You've gotta get her out of your head, man.

Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.

Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.

No.

Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.

Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.

She's really pretty great, isn't she?

Yeah.  Honey?

Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.

I'm totally and completely serious.

So what's up?

Your car?

My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.

How you doin', brother?

Thanks a lot Lloyd.

I don't know.

Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.

I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.

I love you too.

How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?

Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.

He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.

My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.

Oskar, please -

A charade?  How could it be a charade?

I'm sorry to hear that.

I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.

Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.

He's important to my business.

I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.

They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.

I don't know.  Soon.

It's good business.

It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.

Look it up.

Takes diamonds to stay on this list.

Nice things cost money.

How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.

Wine?

The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.

Thank you.

Oskar -

You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.

There will be generations because of what you did.

There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.

The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.

That doesn't work, sir.

I won't.

Alright, alright...I'll call you back.

Stop it...

I'm losing you.

I'm inquisitive.

Don't forget to set the alarm.

Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.

I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.

What?

Its over, Cotton.

Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?

What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?

And much richer as a result.

Tons and tons.

Finish what my son started.

Enter Cotton Weary.

Yeah.

Sid, you don't have to.

I'll get my jacket.

I think it's out of your control.

It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.

So you'll relieve me at 2:30...

I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...

Until now.

The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.

And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.

Tuitions expensive.

I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.

I see you read the book.

Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."

How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?

I think you're all an act.

Meaning?

Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.

What are we looking for?

Dewey, you and I would never make it.

Over here.

No, wait here.

No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.

Don't worry...

It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.

But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.

Please, I have the perfect excuse.

I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.

I'd really just like to be alone.

It's not a good idea, Hallie.

Her old boyfriend?

Thanks, Joel.

But...

..we only promote safe rubbered sex.

Gale?

But...

I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.

Where you going?

I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.

Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.

And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.

I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.

Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?

I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?

Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.

I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.

Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.

Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?

But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!

To me Hollywood is about death.

I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.

Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.

Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.

What does this have to do with Sid?

When it's a threat, you'll know it.

What Rielly?

He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?

And what made you think it was Sidney?

Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.

Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.

Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.

And?

Someone stole Sid's file?

Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!

Do you want us to come with you?

Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?

Sure.

What the hell are you doing?

Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.

Yeah.

I'm hanging up right now.

SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".

Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?

W-what do you want?

You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!

Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.

Who is this?

Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.

I'm sorry, your voice.

Piece of cake. She'll be there.

I was hoping Sid and I could talk.

It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.

Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...

Yes, sir.

I'm sorry. Don't hate me.

What are you doing here?

The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.

Oh Sidney...

Are you serious?

Fuck you.

We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.

You have to have a favorite.

Guess.

Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.

Don't hang up on me.

I can't think.

Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.

Answer the question and I will.

I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?

Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.

You are precious. Please, call me Gale.

Mind if I join you?

I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?

Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.

Yes, you doofus.

I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.

Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.

Not yet.

How is everything?

What were you doing out here?

Have to be. The shit she's gone through.

She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.

Call the police.

The phone's dead.

I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.

But it's so much easier when we make it up.

Just stay back.

Have you talked to Cotton?

He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.

Ricki Lake.

Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

What's your favorite scary movie?

That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.

Uh-huh.

If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.

Who are you?

Sleep tight, sweetie.

Twice.

What are you saying? That I killed her or something?

Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.

Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?

I can cry on cue.

I'll be right back.

You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.

Why are you doing this?

Do they know who did it?

They think it's school-related?

I'll be there by seven. I promise

Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.

He was there, Tatum.

It was him, Tatum. I know it.

I don't know...

With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.

Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."

Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.

He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.

So what?  This victim...

This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.

I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.

I heard.

He's not finished.

Put it down.  Put it on the ground.

Hello.

Why?

Her pretty head.

You'll see.

Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.

You know that's not true.

Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.

You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.

And, why is that?

Sit back.

All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.

Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.

I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.

Can we talk about this in private?

Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?

I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.

I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.

All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?

Nothing.

A switchblade.

It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.

Oh, that's all.

Doesn't seem like our man, does it?

Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.

Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.

No kidding!  No fucking kidding!

No.

No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.

Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.

What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.

How is this legal?

Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.

We're focusing.

The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.

It was him.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

No point in arguing anymore...

These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.

You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.

You do your job...

You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.

It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.

Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.

That part of me is dead.

No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.

When do we get to question him?

You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.

He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?

I will.

What are you talking about?  What happened?

I can't let you do this...

I... I don't understand.

I don't see anything.

I can't do this now... please.

It surprises me.  It really does.

You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.

Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.

You should look into private schools.

I hate this city.

Crime of passion.

It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?

Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.

That'll be the day!...Let's ride.

Huh...? No...no water.

Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.

By what you preach...none!

...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!

Just keep goin'...

That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...

Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...

Now mount up, son...

Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...

Captain Clayton...Captain!

Sir?

Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...

God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...

Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?

But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...

We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...

SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...

Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?

Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?

That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...

Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.

Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...

Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...

I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...

Because she's my...my...

I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...

What's that?

He just couldn't wait...

But I just bought a good blanket.

Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...

Cut it out, will ya...

Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....

What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..

We won't be here...Come on!

What's goin' on?

You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!

That's the breed...Course it might take time.

I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!

No...not yet...

From the beginning...

You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...

I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...

You crazy?

I got to fetch her home...

You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!

We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!

Do you have a better idea?

What?

Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.

We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?

'HE'?  Whom do you mean-

Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!

Thank you.

You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.

A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.

I've killed my husband!

I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...

He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.

Right you are, governor!

Lady?

Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.

Ask him.

No Juliet?!

When I have fifty pounds.

A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.

Ten pounds.

Ned is wrong for it.

Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.

What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?

Yes, but very well.

Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.

Who are you?

Every word.

Fifty pounds? What for?

Is it about a pirate's daughter?

Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.

I did not.

No, it will turn out well.

I don't know, it's a mystery.

How will it?

I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"

Yes, that's good. Until he meets

The daughter of his enemy.

But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.

No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.

"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."

I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.

So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.

Oh. What is your name?

But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.

"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."

My lord.

But why me?

It is to be expected on a Sunday.

Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?

For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!

I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.

Serve.

Will you shut up and play.

It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...

Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --

I'm only asking you both to think about it.

But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.

Then what? Who's going to do what?

Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?

We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?

You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.

Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.

I don't know.

I don't know.

Security.

Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?

Your friends.

Yeah, I was phoning your mother.

It's all right. I'll forward your mail.

Yeah?

Where do you think you'll go?

I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.

I don't know anything about it.

But there's no --

What does it look like?

What?

What?

Yes, thanks.

Cameron?

Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?

Just serve.

She hated you --

He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

Yes.

I thought we all were.

But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.

I want my money back. Excuse me.

For ever and ever.

Who was it?

It tastes different.

Your painful groin?

Oh, good.

And the money?

That's what I thought he said.

I see.

did you hear anything before he cries?

Well, if you do, you'll let us know?

And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?

Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.

I'm sorry.

Two hundred pounds?

You paid two hundred pounds for this?

No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.

Sorry?

Not any real sneering as such, no.

That guy, the one that died.

That's what I thought.

You must be Juliet.

Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.

I'm a doctor.

But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?

Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.

Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.

It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.

Is it real?

Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?

Who?

Yes, but... I thought...

It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?

Lester, don't you think that uhh --

-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---

Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --

I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.

I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.

Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.

What?

What kind of treatment?

And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.

No, that's okay, I'll do It now.

It isn't?

Okay.

Yeah.

No thanks.

Why do you wanna know so bad?

Yeah... I've made it with a girl...

I never get my hair done.

You think that's funny, don't you?

I am not!

Right.

She is.

Great.

Well, yeah... you know.

Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?

Buffums?

Probably the bathroom.

I'd cut it...

Whew.

Yeah... wow.

Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.

... he tried to... uh... make it with me.

Yeah, baby...

That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --

I am you, you little bastard.

Nothing.

-- do you want ice?

Lester's on his way.

Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --

What?

-- Oh yeah.

Otis is dead.

-- oh -- sweetheart...

-- yeah, this is --

Okay... thanks...

Hey, stop by the shop.

No shit?

What?

Honey, what happened?

I am?

Yeah, baby.

Of course I like children.

Okay, baby. Okay...

Okay.

Yeah, baby.

Baby, I'm in the middle of work.

I'll call you.

A business meeting, I told you that.

Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.

I do, Jill.

What is.

I'm very tired, George.

Let go of me.

Oh, Christ.

Where did this come from?

That's all you've got to say?

Yeah, I know. Did you?

Did you?

Thank you.

Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.

Isn't that bad for it?

Now wait a minute...

But...

Oh Jesus Christ.

What, do you think I planned it?

Didn't they tell you?

... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?

We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?

I know.

I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.

Yeah.

I'll call you back.

What do you mean?

Okay.

Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.

You do?

Is that right?

George is going to open a shop.

Who do you think I was talking to?

So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!

Really? How about starting with tonight?

Fine.

Why not?

I'll call you.

Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.

I know, I'm sorry.

Don't be silly.

Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?

I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.

-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.

Didn't you have any panties on?

Sure.

He's a hairdresser.

-- oh I don't know --

-- just wonderful.

Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.

What was the Donner party?

You mean they ate each other up?

Come here for a minute, first.

Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?

Do they know he tell you things?

What about Room 237?

Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?

Danny, come on over here.

No.

Not right now, Daddy's asleep.

Okay, Mom.

Are you having a bad dream?

Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.

Danny, come here!

Danny!

Yes.

Thank you.

Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.

Well how can I repay you?

Yes, sir.

And, er... where are they now?

A nigger.

Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.

Grady... oh.

Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.

Thank you very much.  I'll do that.

Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?

It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.

Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.

Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.

I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.

Yes.

Yes.

I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.

When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?

I'm not going to hurt you.

Stop swinging the bat.

Put the bat down, Wendy.

Give me the bat.

Go away.

Wendy...

Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.

Well...

Well, that sounds fine to me.

They'll love it.

Well, my predecessor in this job

shut in together over long periods of time.

put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.

Well, it's very... homely.

Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.

I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.

Sure, Uncle Al.

If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.

Jane, I have to talk to you.

Will you?

All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.

What kind of noises?

No.

A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?

I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.

But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.

She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.

I don't get you.

Sure.

Yeah, I know. It's great!

What the hell does that matter?

Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.

I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-

I told you!

What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?

Marty, the moon wasn't even full!

Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.

Really?

LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

SING!

SING!

Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?

What did who say?

You did what?

You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?

You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...

Oh-huh.

Oh my! 

Yes, Betty?

D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.

But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?

Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?

No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.

So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.

That man -- who is he?

Get moving.  I'm right behind you.

What a shame!

Whatever.

That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

Sing!

Three years.  Sister.

It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.

You watch yourself!

Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.

Experience!

Give me a C.  A C!

Oh no.  We'll always be together.

Again?

She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.

What did He say?

Enough joking.

Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.

Are you talking about me?

You mean black people?

Would you like that?

Can do.

Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.

No problem.

Silence?  No talking?  All day?

From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 

Mary Clarence!

You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?

Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."

But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?

What do you mean?

I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.

You have a phone call.

I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.

Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.

I'm a Christian.

'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!

A what? When are you qonna wake up?

Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.

You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?

Then-you run.

You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.

Get a stenographer.

Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.

You're supposed to be hiding out!

I've been worried about you.

No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.

You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

What?

You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.

Oh-huh.

You won't even tell us?

You found him -- but we're not open yet.

Which one!

Willy -- hit the lights.

Where is she?

That should have tipped us.

Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.

However, we can also pray for other things.

It's better than ice cream.

She's our inspiration!

And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.

And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.

Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?

What are you spying on?

Bring him.

I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.

No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.

I am the Lord's voice in this town.

You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!

When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!

No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...

Up.

What kind of nuts?

Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.

Father said witches live there.

And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.

Baltus Van Tassel.

There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."

Lady Van Tassel.

Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?

It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.

Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.

I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.

Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.

I doubt that's the end.

Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.

Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.

Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.

There is no such thing as magic.

May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?

You made this, and the drawings?

That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.

If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?

No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...

You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.

If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.

She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?

He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.

Keep climbing.  I will follow...

I can show exactly.

No one will believe your lies, whore.

May I see my mother?

No, sir, please... she is innocent...

Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.

See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.

Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?

What do you like to eat here?

They was a boy. We made friends.

Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?

See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.

I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.

Don't tell me what to do.

What do you want, hun?

I get nervous, that's all I know.

Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --

Shhhh! This is the national anthem.

This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.

How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?

I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.

I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.

I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.

I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.

I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?

You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.

That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.

All right then.

All right then.

If you want me to.

He ain't no count.

Naw.

My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.

A little ol' boy.

I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.

Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.

Yes sir, I reckon it does.

I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.

I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.

Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.

You don't want to give away all your books.

Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.

Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?

I reckon.

Me, too.

I ain't got no boy.

You better go get your things.

Naw.

Yes sir.

My history.

That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.

No ma'am.

It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?

Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.

I could shore use some. Thank ye.

You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.

You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.

I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.

Not really to speak of.

So, you're really going to stay here?

I know.

Signs?

I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.

I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.

Better make it charge. 

I confess.

Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.

Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.

Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.

Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?

For me?  I'll have the same thing. 

What's that, Sol?

What's the difference?

Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."

You run out of Schimmelpennincks?

Yeah, I did.

Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.

It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.

It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.

He's crazy.

We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.

Hi, Auggie.

Uh, better make it one.

Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.

Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 

Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?

I guess so. I never thought of it that way.

Anything for art, eh, Paul?

I mean, it's a good story.

Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?

I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.

Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.

Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.

Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.

It means "happiness."

It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.

And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.

Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.

Bully for you.

Why don't you open it and find out?

For keeps.

I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.

Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.

This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?

What is this, some kind of joke?

You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?

Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!

I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?

Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?

You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.

An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."

That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.

Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?

I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.

Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.

In Manhattan?

Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?

Nice drawing. Did you do that?

Is your father an artist?

Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.

I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.

No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.

Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?

Take good care of yourself, okay?

Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.

Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.

It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.

I just did.

Absolutely. We would be honored.

That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.

That's it. In a nutshell.

That money is my whole future.

It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.

He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....

Good. I'm glad that's settled!

It's all right. I really do know them.

Now ask him who his mother was.

You don't.

Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.

It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.

Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.

No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.

All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?

Well, what if?

Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?

But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?

I lie to my parents every day. And every night.

It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.

I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...

Those aren't the facts that matter.

What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.

Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.

Pretty darn clear.

I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.

My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.

He didn't want to lose any more.

That's how journalists.  Answer questions.

That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.

Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.

Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.

I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.

Yes.

Three kids.  What's she going to do?

Won't take two.

To my father.  Everything counts.

Fell.

Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?

But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.

The knife.  What knife?

I'll take two.  One for later.

Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.

You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.

Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.

Apparently.

Possible.  But not darn likely.

Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?

But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.

Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?

Such as?

Bye.

Get lost, will you?

All right, girls - from the top again.

Fresh!



A what?

What did he say?

How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -

First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -

Quiet - I'm thinking.

We're not too late, are we?

Knock it off, will you?

As far away as possible.

Shave our legs, stupid.

Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.

Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.

I never did like the name Geraldine.

Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!

I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.

It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.

I got pinched in the elevator.

I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -

Don't get burned, Daphne.

Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 

He's going to be ashore with you.

I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.

Have I got things to tell you!

Security.

Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.

So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.

Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.

What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.

Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.

Terribly sorry.

I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.

I'll say.

If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.

Sssh.  Sweet Sue.

We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.

No.  It's nice and cozy.

No, no.

You got some?

I may spill something.

A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?

She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.

Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.

It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.

Oh yes, we do!

Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.

Yes.

I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.

And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.

Yes.  For a whole year.

The Florida job?

You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.

- you got to be blonde -

Help yourself.

Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?

You don't say.

Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.

Bull fiddle.

Wanna bet?

Why?

No, thank you.  I'll walk.

Flower girl.

Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.

And I smoke. I smoke all the time.

We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.

Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -

The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -

It's three weeks in Florida -

It's not the backs that worry me.

You got to be under twenty-five -

William Morris!

There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.

Where did he conduct?

No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.

You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.

Every time!

But you're a girl, thank goodness.

So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.

What's in Florida?

Well, now that you've mentioned it -

Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?

Good night, Sugar.

She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.

Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.

For your own amusement?

It's been delightful meeting you both.

What?

Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.

Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.

It's all right for a bachelor.

Oh - a member of the herring family.

Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...

I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.

Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.

Oh, you couldn't possibly.

How can you think about food at a time like this?

All right - if you insist.

Lets throw another log on the fire.

Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

From a rich millionaire.

Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.

According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -

Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.

That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.

I come to the old lady's funeral.

Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.

Who's going to raid a funeral?

Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?

Big joke!

What for?

Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?

Bacardi 151.

What? Why? What do you mean?

What for?

Actually, I do.

I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.

Why, with you.

I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.

Mom, please.

I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.

No.

Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.

Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.

I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.

I dont know.

On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.

Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.

Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.

Shampoo, got it!

What?!

I disappear. Its not about me.

Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.

Its my job.

I didnt say he was worth it.

Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.

Hi.

You knew?

Give it back? Are you nuts?

Its complicated, Dad.

...but its getting there. 

Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.

--and The ass of The man who adores her.

Will do.

Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.

David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.

I try...

Sure--

What do that mean?

Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--

:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.

:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.

NO! N-O, NO!

Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.

Yes, sir...

"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"

I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.

Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.

Where was you, Daddy?

We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?

I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...

Mornin', Daddy...

September 4 -- how far away is that?

My father taught me...

Yes, David...

That's right!

Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.

Same as we -- they pray.

'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.

Listen, Mama...

Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.

Yes, son. You better get back to bed.

Yes, mam...

Did you find your father?

I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.

It's the heat.

He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.

Come in, children.

I'll walk...

I'm used to it.

Might be...

I wanta get some things.

I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.

I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...

What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?

I'll wait till after the children.

Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.

I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.

You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!

Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.

Pillow.

OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--

Fragile?

-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?

Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!

Sheet!

'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...

Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.

I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!

Yes, hon?

I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!

Eric, that is not appropriate.

Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.

Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.

Something big, children.

Oh no, it's that kid.

Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!

Uhh...

Mrph mprph!!

Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

Uhh... Bacon.

FREEZE!!

Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?

Where do they come up with this stuff?!

Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

Our moms suck!

How do we do that?

Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!

Wow!

No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.

Me?!

What is 'fisting'?

Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?

As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.

Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!

Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!

Oh.

Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.

I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.

Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.

My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?

YOU'D fuck your uncle!

The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?

Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.

You would know, dummy.

I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.

I know, Terrance. I know.

Hey, come here, guy.

Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!

Don't call me dumb!

Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.

Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.

Hi Stan.

What's the matter, Wendy?

God damn it, why does she keep saying that?

And the butfor?

He's shutting off the air!!!

It can't be.

Of course, of course...

Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.

Very professional of you.

I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.

Well it's a good thing that I did.

Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.

Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -

It's steady, good benefits.

Well, maybe I'll surprise you.

Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!

You better start making sense!

We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?

Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?

That's clear.

Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!

Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.

Like that piece of ass he was with.

Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.

Will you shut up already?

That's right.

Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?

Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?

Close every door behind you!

Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?

One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...

Sure.

Helllp!

A flare?  A flare won't do it.

I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.

I'm about to blow the wall.

We have room!  Let's go!

We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!

And so far.

Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.

Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.

Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.

He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?

Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.

How am I supposed to know?

Talk to him...Jesus...

That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.

Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.

I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.

You afraid we're gonna steal it?

How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!

It was a clearance.

Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.

Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.

We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?

Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.

I'm sure you have Buzz.

They suspended me for 100 years.

I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.

It's mine.

What's it look like to you?

Don't say that about my mom!

I am underground.

I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.

Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.

See ya 'round Maynard.

Clam it!

He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.

Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?

SHEILA!

Someone wants to play with me?

If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 

No!

You know who I am?

What ever happened to just bowling?

He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.

He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.

Bowling "Center"!

She hit it, Mr. Kastle!

Yippy!

It's a vicious cycle.

The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.

I'd rather you didn't.

Not while I'm in training.

Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.

So, what about you?

We'll get into that later.

No, I'm fascinated.

Well, that was plan A.

Plan B is your dad.

He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.

What's plan C?

It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.

I could let them go for ten.

If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.

Why should I help that old fuck.

You got any broken bones?

Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.

Why not?

Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.

Did you - kill him?

I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.

I'm looking for somebody.

We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.

Tell your little pal to let go.

Dwarf bowling's illegal.

Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.

Calm down, Dr. Levine.

Please, Dr. Levine.

I can't see...

Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.

Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.

Forty yards.

What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?

Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.

Now!

Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.

Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.

Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?

-- Wait a second --

ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?

But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.

You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --

If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.

Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.

You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?

Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.

Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.

Harry?  Can you copy?

What the hell is going on here?

In a minute, sir.

What?

Ted seems to have some ideas.

The what?

We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?

What's the message?

He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.

Radiation shield, you think?

What do you make of this?

What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?

To what?

What's inside the sphere.

The sensors are picking up something outside.

What was Edmunds doing outside?

We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.

The library.

What about you?  What happened to you?

Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.

What?

Yeah, why?

Where did you get this?

What?

It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.

You don't trust me?

I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?

What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?

Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.

You think?

What?

But how?

How can the sphere do that?

Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.

Something for burns.

Bingo.

Antibiotic.

Causes sleep.

Your watch.

You think I'd really drink that?

You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.

Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?

You tell me.

What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?

No, he isn't.

Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?

Don't fuck with me, Beth.

You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?

Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.

Leave me alone, Norman.

Beth -- gimme the gun.

Hear what?

Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.

Who says it's a he?

All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.

We never even had a conversation, Norman.

Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.

In time for what?

Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.

What?

Look, would you --

Whatever I can do to help.

Gimme another explanation.

Am I?

Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.

I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?

I thought she was with you.

You know what it is, Harry.

Help me lift her.

Are you trying, damn it?  Just --

Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.

Wait!

We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.

You mean forget?

It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.

It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.

Does this mean what I think it means?

What report?

Told me what?

You mean a picture?

Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.

He didn't say much at all.  Honey --

I'm beginning not to like you.

I know that.

You could put it that way.

But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.

But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.

Don't you have a Kiber crystal?

Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.

Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.

I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.

You look great!  The uniform and everything!

But there was a lot of firing earlier...

I'll make a report later.

What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?

We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.

I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.

That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.

Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.

Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.

No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.

They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.

Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.

Who is this?  What's your operating...

You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...

Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.

Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.

It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!

Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !

I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.

YAAAAAAAA !

Death to all bugs !

Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.

Your father will never let you.

If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.

Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.

The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.

No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.

You and me, huh ?

Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.

Funny...

No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.

Excuse me...!

You're upset, that's alright.

Who ?

Excuse me...!

Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.

Good luck at the academy.

Who cares ?

Shhh...

My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

I like it. It's kinda...you.

Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...

Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.

You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.

Teenagers !

Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?

We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.

A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...

It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.

Oh, is that how it is ?

I won't quit !

It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.

Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?

Keep trying, Sergeant.

Sir, thank you, sir !

Sir, yes it is, sir.

Here in Buenos Aires.

Aw, don't get mushy.

Johnny, please. Calm yourself.

Hi, mom.

Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !

Not a problem.

Been better, buddy.

Uh, I don't know.

Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.

Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.

Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

We're not leaving you here, sir !

That is how V'ger will survive.

By the Creator.

V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...

It will... take me from <U>you</U>...

They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.

Mr. Scott... on my next signal.

No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.

Permission to speak freely, sir?

How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!

It's taken control of the computer...!

I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.

This served the purpose.

It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.

I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?

Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!

No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...

Impact in fifteen seconds...

Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...

Communicated with us <U>how</U>?

Any reply from them?

... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.

Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?

Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.

A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.

The point... 

... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.

That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.

Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...

I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.

He'll eat potroast and like it.

I need a typewritter.

Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.

You quit.

It's about life.

That's true.  You grow up here?

No, no, I see...

Of course.

Goodbye.

Surest thing you know.

...I always thought so...

You're still here.

What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?

Yes.

Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...

You got a paperclip?

Paperclip?

You going to ask me in?

Read the card.

Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?

Sure did.

I can't get it to come out right.

It used to be the Old Mill.

...take <u>any</u> two people...

Going home.

What?

No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?

People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...

You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?

But that's what happened.

Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.

Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...

Yes, that's right.

That's so beautiful...

Where have you been...

Well, then, what's he doing here?

You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...

Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?

It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.

They know what her tits look like.

Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...

I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!

And I need a drink.

Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...

What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...

...you got to get me that street for nothing...

Fifteen hands.

That Could Be.

We missed you in Church today, Frank.

Sure, what have you got?

...not if you've got something to hold on to.

What...

You mind...?

Well, Officer, don't worry ab...

The Mayor's outside.

Mr. Bailey.

Then what is the...?

I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...

He's on the Island, he'll be back on...

Oh.

Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...

Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...

Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?

I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.

...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...

Well, Joe said it, and he's right.

Marty...

I'll put the, in your r...

Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?

Yes.

Well.

Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...

This young woman.

...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...

He told you that...

I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...

Gut Yuntif.

You mean <u>with White</u>...?

You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?

Sure.

You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?

My wife is going to have a baby, and...

Did you, where are we going tonight...?

You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?

I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.

That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...

I know you do.

Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?

Where have you been...?

He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!

It's not <u>you</u>, it's...

The girl was in the car.

I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.

I can write it.  I can't type it.

The breasts symbolize motherhood...

No.

A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...

I left that for you.

What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?

That's what I said.

She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.

He's got a gift for fiction.

That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.

I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...

Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?

So we just got lucky.

Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...

I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.

I killed her!

Excellent point.

Why does Rachel scream?

...why do you think?

Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!

I bet.

Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!

...I'm not deaf, y'know.

And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?

I'm not.

Until he's old enough to read.

I'll miss you so much.

This is my daddy's house --

<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...

But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!

He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!

See, I...

Why don't you say hello?

Annabelle pick up the phone.

Suits me <u>fine</u>!

No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.

YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?

No.

No!

No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...

Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.

Yes.

You have the WORST flu since...

Is your bad?

I helped.

Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...

No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.

Don't do this.

Partly.  But partly, you're mad.

<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.

And I'm supposed to care.

Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.

No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.

Stop.  You're making me insecure.

This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...

What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?

Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...

...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...

But it's not on the schedule!

You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.

Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.

I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.

It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.

Wowie.  How wonderful!

Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.

I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.

How the hell would you know?

You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!

...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.

It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.

Do what you've worked your whole life to do?

You mean, after I'm dead?

Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.

He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?

It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...

I have their past.

Yeh, it's cheaper.

I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --

But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.

It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --

Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...

Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?

Rache, it may take time.

What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.

Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.

Hey. What's up?

What?

Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?

Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.

It was God's will.

No, Mikey.

I'm always working.

This is work.

No.

My Jesus

My baby.

You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.

What?

Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.

I dunno.

How was the class?

You mean, again?

Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.

Don't be so upset. It's OK...

You know he hated my story also.

I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.

...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?

Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...

Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.

Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!

Sure, Dad.

What are you doing here?

I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.

Take off your top.

Say, Ni...

Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'

Oh, fine. How are you?

Great!

I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.

Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?

Yeah, sure.

You should be.

Yeah. I know.

Y-yes--

Well, I-I hope that--that--

Why? Are we going dancing?

Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:

What happened!

You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.

After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.

What happened?

Well Cooper...

I don't see why they wouldn't be.

Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!

I don't want any...

I said I don't want any, goddammit!

We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.

Chemco's been developing nerve gas?

The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!

I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...

Richter-we got a problem!

Excellent...excellent!

What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.

You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?

Dissent?

How much of this shit do they have, White!!

Certainly - how about some breakfast?

Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.

At his office in the Capitol.

Did you get that, Kulnick?

First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.

Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.

It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.

I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.

See!  See, I told you.

Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...

Look, I didn't shoot him!

Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.

Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!

What is your name, young lady?

What did you say, sir?

Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --

I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.

Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.

This is General Ripper speaking.

No, sir.

That's right, sir.

I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.

Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?

No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.

I know that, sir.

Ask away, Major.

You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't

You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.

Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?

Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.

You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?

But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?

I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.

Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.

Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.

Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.

Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?

But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.

Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?

And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?

What the hell is Plan-R?

Why can't you cancel it?

That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!

Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!

Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.

If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.

Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?

Can't help it.  What's the wind like?

They must have clobbered some of our cities already!

Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.

Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.

Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.

Hey, Terry, I'm hit.

Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.

Primary arming switch.

Very interesting.

Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.

Seond safety.

All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.

Hell, he looks dead.

What do you mean?

Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.

You tell me.

It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?

But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.

Let me check.

Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?

I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.

Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?

Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

I don't anymore.

Yeah.

Yeah, I guess.

Was it okay?

I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.

Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?

No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?

Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.

Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.

Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.

Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!

Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.

Okay.

... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!

No, no.

No, no, I wasn't trying.

No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.

No, I mean, no one.

Uh, last night...

Buff, can you listen to me for a second?

No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.

You know?

No.

Jeff! Let's go!

Yeah, right, publicist.

Wait, what happened to the tree?

Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!

Sure I am. It's fun.

In what way?

This is private property, my friend.

Are you talking to me?

Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.

No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.

Yes!

Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.

Oh, yeah?

Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.

He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.

Funny shit, man.

He's drunk.

Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.

Sooze wants to see him.

Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?

What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?

I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.

No.

Yeah, fuck 'em.

Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!

No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.

You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.

You don't know?

Is that Bee-Bee?

Okay. Nazeer, okay?

Nazeer Chaudry!

No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.

You know, all you know is what's good for you.

Tim!

... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.

No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?

Nothing.

Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?

I, yeah.

Wait. What, what are you saying?

'Bye, Jeff.

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.

Yeah, really.

Yeah.

Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?

No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.

Well, what about this?

Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?

Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?

This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.

It's stupid.

Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?

Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's because I am.

Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?

Where do you get your ideas?

"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"

What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.

It's none of my business?

Yeah.

Uh, eleven twenty-five.

It's not the air force anymore, Scuff

Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.

Come on, Jeff.

Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.

Oh that's nice for you.

There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".

You piece-a-shit bug zapper!

You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.

Wayne Gretzky.

My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?

No...I've been pregnant.

No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.

And they get caught!

So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.

Of course - of course!  Hands in...

That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!

Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.

Trix...

Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.

We're here for you, Diane.

Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?

He Ikea'd us.

I guess there's an exception to every rule.

Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.

Uh...maybe?

Bank branch!

Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.

My what?

Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.

Stop it!  This is crazy!

I hear she was a terror to work with.

You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.

Action! The scene starts.

Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.

I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.

Nothing for Ladd?

Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.

I just think pictures should say a little something.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.

Sure.  Bases Loaded.

Dark Windows.  How did you like it?

I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.

Life can be beautiful!

Is that so? What's the wonderful news?

Well, for heaven's sake!

Why should you do that?

See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.

This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.

It will?

Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...

Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.

It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.

I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?

I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?

No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.

Joe, I can't look at you any more.

That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?

Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.

Lady.  you've got the wrong man.

Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.

Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.

Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.

Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.

I don't know.

December twenty-first.

Are you married, Mr.  -- ?

You can stay here.

Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.

I'll take care of that.

I'm used to paying my own bills.

Just a scene I cut out.

The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -

Can't you wait till I'm dummy?

What's wrong with It?

I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.

There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.

Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?

Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?

What kind of a silly thing was that to do?

Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.

They're awful.  They make me cough.

Maybe deMille is shooting.

He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.

Good night.

I went for a walk.

I haven't done anything, Norma.

Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.

You think I made that up about the gun...

Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.

Go on in.

Dressed for what?

Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.

It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.

I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.

That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.

I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.

It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.

What car?

It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.

Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.

Frankly, no.

Maybe what you need is another agent.

Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.

Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.

Yes, Madame.

Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.

But the phantom Zone is for criminals.

What is it?

The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .

And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!

He will be. In about five minutes.

No, a super girl.

I've been saving it. For the right moment.

Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.

And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!

Who didn't?

It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.

Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.

Terrific.

Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.

I sort of like what you said.

It seemed that way to me.

I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...

Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.

What an adorable hat.

But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.

Well...I guess I can't.

I've got things to do.

How do you know?

Did anybody notice you?

Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!

I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.

Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-

It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.

No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?

Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?

But what for?

It doesn't seem right.

He's nice.

I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.

It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.

Throw him out.

We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.

Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.

Not yet.

It's the most beautiful place in the universe.

It's everywhere. But water is always the door.

I knew it!

Going to try. Didn't say I could.

Don't stop. Keep moving.

It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.

Zaltar!

Buddy, are we in trouble.

Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.

There's no vodka in it.

What? What did you tell me?

Brad.

Brad Wilson.

You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?

And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.

It sure is.

You thought that?

But all he had was chocolate milk.

Uh-huh.

Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.

Kent!

We get together sometimes.

Say!

I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.

Gus Gorman.

Yeah.

Thirty-five.

What about this week's check?

What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?

Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...

Black or regular?

Which country?

Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.

Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

First question got to be "Where."

Just the man I wanted to see!

What are you talking about, fella?

They ain't got captains?

Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.

I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!

I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?

Don't be getting' racist with me, man.

For what?

What will it get me?

Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.

Sister! I'm his sister!

Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.

What about me?

Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.

Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!

Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.

But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!

Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---

53!

How'm I supposed to turn this thing?

Why do I have to do this?

My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.

Storms! Floods!

Today coffee----

Don't cry, Bubba.

We can get to work on that oil!

Yeah. I'll check.

But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.

That's because you can hardly see through those things.

I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?

Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.

Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !

Lois, I . . .

We'd better talk.

I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.

Oh, hi.

You're not selfish at all.

Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.

Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.

Take it easy. Take a deep breath.

That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --

The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.

I wouldn't know. I've never had one.

So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.

It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.

It's beautiful.

Wrong.

Yes.

No possibility for parole?

I asked the right question.

I didn't ask her anything . . .

To ski?

Oh! That black box in our cell?

Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.

Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .

Cuba.

It will. Starting with your own.

Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.

What shall we do now?

Yes?

Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.

Don't worry, I've got you.

Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.

I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.

It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.

Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.

And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.

Absolutely!

Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.

I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.

Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?

. . . And  very nave!

Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!

A toupee that flies?

Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .

Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?

There!

What?

Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.

Wait! Not yet! Back!

Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.

We're running out of smoke.

He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.

North. It's north

Well!

No.

What the  --  !

No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.

Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.

You're not the only one.

You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?

Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.

Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.

What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?

Tough guy, huh?

Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?

Bingo!

I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?

I don't like to talk about it, Lex.

You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.

You?! How about me?

Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.

A night on the town instead of under it?

What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?

Lex is going bye-bye.

You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -

'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 

Don't brag now,  Jonathan.

A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.

I want to know what my child is going to face.

Enjoyed it?

Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.

Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.

Ask, You're the girl reporter.

The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.

It's not bad.

Thirty-five.

Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.

I guess I...uh...regressed.

Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.

Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.

Ally.  That was my nickname.

How is Mrs. Stephens?

Sunnyridge.  That was a long time

It turns to steaming piss.

Not unless you can raise the dead.

You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.

Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...

Was it good?

Okay.

Yeah.

Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.

So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.

C'mon, you know that won't...

I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.

No.  It should be dry by now.

Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.

Why?

Well I don't.

Do they have any reputation for drugs?

Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...

And what's that?

You mentioned that he had a learning disability.

Did his parents attend to that?

Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.

What other people?

A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.

No.  A little sugar though.

Summer's over.  It's fall.

I won't lie.

You seem very sure about that.

Was the bus on time?

Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto

She...she was a friend of mine.

People who will help our cause.

Crafts?

Thanks.

Is there shrimp on it?

Who did they get for that?

Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.

And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?

Yes.

I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.

Really?

It's okay.

As opposed to this T.V.?

How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.

It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.

But Charlene...

You don't know that.

Alone or surrounded?

Don't apologize for me, Frank!

Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!

Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.

Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.

Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.

I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...

And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?

Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?

Give me a chance --

He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?

But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...

I thought we were talking about Sidney?

I'm taking up the situation with you now...

A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...

No...

No.  I'm going home.

Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?

You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.

You print them, don't you?

Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?

Get Steve back his job...please...

Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.

No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.

She knows now.

He goes out with girls.

Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!

And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?

No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.

I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.

Help me with two minutes of silence!

Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...

Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.

Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -

Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.

Temple, I caught your act the other night and -

You tell him, I stutter!

What ship?

Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...

That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!

Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?

Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...

But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...

I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...

You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.

Max.

It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.

Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!

Of course.  I'm a terminator.

Why?

Right.

No problemo.

Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.

I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?

I'm sorry, John.

Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.

I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?

SHOOT!!!!

Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.

Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.

There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!

And Skynet fights back.

Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?

No.  There is another chip.

Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.

But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?

A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.

Not yet.

Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!

In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.

There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.

I have a duty.

No. Ours was damaged.

I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.

Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?

I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...

Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?

I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.

During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.

If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.

Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.

Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.

Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?

No!

No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.

I don't understand what you mean.

It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.

Do you know Hans Hinkel?

Helmuth.

How could I forget?

So. You wanted to see me.

Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...

One of my people?

No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.

Who's he?

His private life?

Like this bandleader.

Absolutely not.

He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?

You're late.

Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?

It's not brain surgery, Chuck.

A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...

We will, kiddo.

What's it to ya?

What's it to ya?

Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...

Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.

What?

What about it?

That's the way it was told to me.

Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.

It's better that way.

Kyle...

Yes.

That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.

You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.

I know.

Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...

Now, look...

Did you?  Kudos.

I said I was sorry...

What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.

What... is... happening... ?

What are you talking about?

You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?

Why not?

You first.

You pull me up.

What's C.R.S.?

Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!

... two hundred dollars a toe.

Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.

I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.

Well... the red bra.

I didn't say anything.

What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...

What... what do you mean?

You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?

They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!

What are you doing?

Stop it!

Single?

Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.

"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.

Which grad-school?

Elizabeth?

No.

I said I would...

Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.

You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.

No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.

Stop this.  It's not true...

This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.

Yes.

Yes.

I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...

What's all this for?

No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?

Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.

Don't take another step.

Have we met?

Is there a room key?

No, you didn't...

Have a nice day.

Thank you.  Goodnight.

Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.

Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?

It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...

His behavior... ?

A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...

Nothing.  Nothing at all.

That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.

It was a misunderstanding.

What about the house?

What?

Who's Watts?

I did okay.

I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.

Yeah.

Sure.

Go ahead.

It's a question.

Just stay there, Nell!

He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.

It was very specific.

I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.

Yes.

I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.

I don't know.

Nell.  You will come here now.

Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.

How'd I know it was for you?

Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.

Good morning, Theo.  Luke.

Mary came with me.

How could you do this to people?

That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?

I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.

It's all I could afford.

My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?

Maybe you did it yourself.

Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.

Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --

Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.

I don't think I want any.

I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.

I'm loyal to things that make me happy.

All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.

Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.

Why not?

This is un-fucking professional.

Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.

And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.

We'll find him.

You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.

England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.

Round about, yeah.

It was better than a telegram.

Terry Valentine.

I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...

That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.

Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.

Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.

What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?

Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.

Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.

He's brought in the heavy mob.

You goin' back inside?

Well, those are the breaks.

No, but I know what he means.

Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?

I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."

Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.

Now who's being sarcastic?

Not ashamed.

She never told Eddie, though.

-- Mr. Lindgren.

We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.

He alive to see this?

Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?

A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.

She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.

How do you know?

Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.

Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.

And that is?

My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.

He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.

Ian?

Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.

Nine years?  Is that legal?

Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.

I don't know.

So what.

Lemme break.

Something's on.

Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."

I doubt it.

Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.

Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?

I don't want you here, Terry.

Susan.

We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.

A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.

Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.

I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

That's what he keeps telling me.

Boy.

Oh, Mr Crane--

He didn't say that.

Well? How'd she do?

I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--

Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--

That right.

I'll have it in a week.

Way out of line.

Sure.

Yeah.

And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--

...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

...Huh?

Just coffee.

Honey?

Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.

How's that?

I didn't say a word.

Honey...

What happened to you?

Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

I... just knew. A husband knows.

I don't know. I don't think so.

I took Doris's keys.

So, who should I--

Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...

Yeah.

Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.

Sorry, I just didn't remember.

Uh-huh.

Yeah, yeah--go home.

Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.

Yeah.

Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--

Uh-huh.

Huh? No.

Crane. Ed Crane.

Hello.

Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.

They sent us to tell ya.

Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.

I'm in.

We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.

Where's the walk-in safe?

What's the combination?

Calm down.  I found it!

Let's go!

Like hell!

Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.

Correct.

Apparently it's huge.

What is it?

I know.

Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.

Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.

I'm not giving up.

You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.

Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.

I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.

Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.

That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.

Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."

Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.

Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?

We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.

We will.

Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.

I don't believe it.

They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.

Big as a house.

Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.

They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.

The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.

Holy mother, what is that?

Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.

Another storage room.

But at what a price.

Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.

You have time to talk?

You were afraid of him, weren't you?

I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?

I don't know.

You were behind me?  Running after me?

I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.

No.  I think I'm hallucinating.

It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.

We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.

The planetarium!

No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...

Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.

How?

I have to shoot.

One.

We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.

--a dead one at that.

As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.

All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.

Guess I always thought they'd adopt.

So when are you leaving?

Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?

Your Dad?!

It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?

Truman, you're gonna be late!

It's a surprise.

I've been thinking--

I made macaroni.

You blaming me for the traffic?

There's been an accident, Truman.

I'm sure they're just exaggerating.

Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.

Do something...

--Truman, you're gonna be late!

Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.

Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.

We don't even know you.

Me?

Nothing completely conclusive --

Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.

No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.

Incinerate it. Like the others.

No. Don't bother.

Yeah, I did.

I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.

Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.

You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?

Yeah, well I don't have them all.

I've been using you?!

I told you -- he and I were old friends --

Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.

What happened to playing a hunch?

The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...

No you didn't.

I'm in the vending room.

Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.

I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...

They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

According to this tag.

You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.

We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?

It looks pretty green for this climate.

All the equipment is brand new.

I don't know, Mulder.

That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.

-- of what exactly?!

Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --

I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.

I don't know.

We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --

I need you on this, Scully --

You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.

I think you're in anaphylactic shock --

General McAddie's.

But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.

I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.

A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.

That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --

No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.

You need not kill a man to destroy him.

Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?

Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...

And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.

Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.

I don't need them anymore...

Give a kiss to Edward.

As far as I needed.

You don't know the procedure.

Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.

Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.

Little boy?!  That's him!

Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.

All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.

No problem.

What's wrong?

She's bringing Stargher into hers.

Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...

Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.

Awaiting his arrival.

It's his dog.

Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.

Ja, ja, ja.

Do you understand German?

I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?

In German?

Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

What's that?

Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.

I'm so sorry.

Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.

Why?

I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.

There isn't enough for two laughs.

Oh...

How did you know I would be here?

I saw him today.

Why are you lying?

If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.

Thank you.

We loved each other, do you mean that?

Two weeks ago.

I don't know.

I don't want it.

Just around the corner.

Holly Martins.

I can't say that I have.

What are you trying to say?

Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.

Getting around, Martins.

Calloway.

I see.

She's right. It's none of my business.

You all did.

I said you win.

Two thirty.

Oh, Mr. Martins...

I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.

Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

Goodness, that's awkward.

Good evening Mr. Crabbin.

Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.

Of course, of course, of course.

Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.

Very popular. Are you staying long?

Yes.

It's good to see you, Holly.

I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...

Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.

What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?

Vinkel.

I understand...

Mr. Lime - yes.

und ich kann nicht alle kennen.

You saw it?

Yes.

Funny?

Help you out?

I'm sorry, I don't think so.

I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.

Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.

So how many miles do you think it is?

I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.

Yes.

Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.

I'm sorry.

Fuck off.

Eh - bonsoir.

Hi there. Here, take a look.

Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.

If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.

We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....

I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....

Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!

The Zionists aren't Nazis.

They sound like you.

Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?

Then I won't bring you....

Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --

Fire...

No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.

I have a job.

I don't care about money.

Nobody reads that stuff anymore.

Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?

At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.

You want it to be an event.

Yes, I am. Basically I am.

Oh, really?

Then how come you're talking to me?

I stole it. From a synagogue.

That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.

No.

What do you care?

What's it mean?

Why?

Why not?

Even though his dick is so big?

V'asitem...

Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.

Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.

It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.

'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.

And be crushed.

You gotta get out of here.

I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.

Who's Eichmann?!!?

It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.

I've been waiting all my life for something like this.

Sexuality??? What do you mean?

Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?

He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.

So you're saying it's not true.

Listen to me....

Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.

No.

Get the fuck away from me.

The arguments, anyway.

With the shoes... There was more than one?

A forty-five.

Fucking kike.

It's German.

From the Rhineland originally.

Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.

Fine.

That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?

It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.

Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.

Yeah, hey, how're you doing...

Wow, that's uh...great...

Four. But no one this important.

Okay, that's it. You're going back to --

Dennis Leary.

No.

Funny?

And that's when the Mets started to stink.

As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...

Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.

Yes.  Not like Enzo.

But your man isn't quite a God!

Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?

Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.

... So am I.

I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.

Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!

Hello!

In a lake.

No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!

I won't, I swear.

No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.

You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?

The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?

Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?

I didn't say...  Brussels!

It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.

What room have you got?

Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.

Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!

No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?

... Yes.

Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?

... I was right about what?

... Okay.  I'll try.

I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?

I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?

Uh... Yes, of course!

I did?

I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.

I'm still here.

... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.

... Nothing.

You go back, I'll walk.

... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.

Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.

Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.

He doesn't hear too well.

Well... here.

Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.

Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.

He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.

C'mon follow me.

No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...

When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?

No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.

Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?

Mazel Tov!

I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.

But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.

Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.

The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.

Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.

Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.

If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.

Why not?

I don't know -

You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.

Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.

You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.

Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-

Who?

You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...

Rosita  I have wondered -

She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.

You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.

Good evening.

Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?

Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.

It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.

Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?

Not! I tell you. No!

Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --

There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.

I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.

No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 

Something's wrong with this whole setup --

Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?

Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.

I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.

Yeah.

Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?

He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.

Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.

Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.

If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.

I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.

Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?

What! You can't be --

We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.

Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...

You a tourist?

I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.

When will they be back?

You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?

Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.

What... What are you talking about?

Excuse me?

Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?

You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?

Have you got a pen?

Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?

I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...

Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.

I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!

Something like that.

Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...

What are you doing? You cant. I...

Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.

The dead can wait.

A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?

A coffee and a couple of croissants.

Croissants. Like that...

Im fine standing, thank you.

Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...

Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.

Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.

So who... Whos the man? Where is he?

Italian? The Mafia...?

That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...

Emily...

Shell be alright. Shes tough...

This is a bad line.

What sort have you got?

What about an untrained pup, white...

Tomorrow?

Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?

...On holiday?

Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...

The company. We all work for the company.

Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...

Ill call again.

Can I have the reception desk, please.

I certainly did, sir...

La what?

That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 

Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 

What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?

May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?

Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.

He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.

Anything at all?

This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.

Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?

This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.

I dont recollect mentioning a friend.

Shut up!

Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?

Do you know Leons parents names?

My sister... She lives in the next valley.

Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?

Tu sais o me trouver.

Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...

Fuck...

What do you think, huh?

Shut up and walk...

Its a good guess...

Very generous of you all.  How much?

No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.

Now?

How dare you stop me doing God's will!

How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!

Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...

Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?

You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.

Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?

To marry you.

I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.

It would not be the same without you.

Not yet!

I want to stay with you...

I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!

And so I... I prefer my banner.

You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?

... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?

She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...

Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!

Scared of a girl?

What about you?

I will hear you... but not now, not here.

Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.

In a village called Domremy.

Not unless you hear my confession.

Not unless you hear my confession.

Many things...

I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...

Buying her?

W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?

Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...

I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.

I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.

20,000 gold crowns.

I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.

I know...

For what?

Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...

I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!

We need another ten minutes...

Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?

As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.

Me too...

I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.

But the bridge has been pulled down!

I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...

Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...

So... bring up the reinforcements!

Jeanne, look behind you.

But my voices... they promised me...

No...

No...!

That's now what I meant...

I know, but that's not the way things happened...

Yes, but...

Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!

They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.

I'd sooner die than use magic!

... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!

A few teeth... that's the price of his life?

I -- I -- I...

They're going to come and visit you in here?

I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.

Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!

So your memory's coming back?

In His name??

I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?

Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?

Do you think this cross will protect you?

Do you think you are ready?

Are you willing to follow all His commandments?

I need to confess again.

Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?

Oh yes, I play with them... lots...

Yes, it is.

A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.

Oh, yes. I remember.

You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.

Wladek, please.

How will we sleep?

Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.

What's happened?

I haven't seen him.

Who told you?

That makes a change.

You're out, aren't you?

I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.

Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!

Yes, so did the Germans.

Yes, but what good did it do?

There are always notices going up.

I didn't know you were in the certificate business.

Cow!

Pack, Wladek, there's no time.

God forbid!

Stop it, Wladek.

Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.

Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.

That is good, yes.

The Alps.

Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.

Yes, it's unholy.

No, no bible readers.

I'll be back.

Yes, I thought that.

Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED

Ada says you're doing well with the piano?

They are washed.

Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....

She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.

Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!

That's right.

Who told ya this guy was in here?

What's the line on Visitation?

He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.

How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!

What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.

Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.

Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.

Why?

We'll get by without 'em.

If we ever get to it.

Well we got some workin' money anyway.

What do ya mean?

Did he say he wouldn't?

Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?

See ya and raise three.

You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.

Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.

Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

Where's June today?

Where you goin'?

And you expect me to come over, just like that.

No.  They're just the only ones we know of.

Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.

This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.

Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.

I'll make parole.

If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.

We missed him.

Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.

He'll never do it.

No.

Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.

You know how they are... sex...

Is that what it means?

Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 

That is, if it's all right with you.

Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 

Oh, Andy, Andy!

It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.

He wouldn't say.

tried him once -

We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?

What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?

Which way did she fall?

He's been dead for three months.

Yes, she would.

We were planning to be married right after Christmas.

You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.

And he still wants to marry me!

Better get home before it is.

Going to run him through the fluoroscope?

Not a thing.

I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.

What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!

We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.

What'd he think it was to you?

I'm asking you.

No.

I'll have to try to remember.

You mean about that gun?

I think we're on the right track.

I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.

When was that?

I see.

Why yes.

I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.

Let him have his say out.

Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.

I guess all the suspects are here.

Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.

He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.

What bonds?

Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....

supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?

Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.

Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?

Never mind.

Is Julia going with you?

That's all right.  What are you drinking?

I haven't been a detective for four years.

What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?

Hello, Mimi.

Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.

I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...

Yes...

Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.

I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.

He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.

And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.

You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.

Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?

I didn't knock Julia off.

I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.

This is your party.

He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.

If you like 'em like that.

I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.

Much better, thanks.

That last Martini.

What are you drinking?

There's nothing I can do to help her.

Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?

Well, didn't you?

Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.

I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.

Yes.

Let's see.  Where's it from?

Your guess is as good as mine.

I don't believe he did it.

Looks like a hold-up!

I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.

You wouldn't be a widow long.

Not with all your money!

I did find him!

It was his body that was buried there.

Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?

Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.

Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.

Got a nice evening dress?

I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.

I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.

Yes.

Two weeks work gone for nothing.

I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!

You did.

Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

We're going to keep driving.

Wha...

You just go when I say go.

And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.

Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.

Let me see the map.

You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.

Maybe I do.

I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.

Suppose I don't go for that?

Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?

Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.

If I give it to you, will you let us go?

Knock it off!

Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?

What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.

Roger that.

Oh, that's fun.

Wh-what do you think--

I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

I heard it click.

We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.

Me and Wes are just going to talk.

I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!

You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!

If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.

The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.

So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.

Something like that.

Stay low.

We're not going to do anything.

So where do we start?

What does it look like I'm doing?

What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...

Jesus, Jaeger.

Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.

We'll find our way.

Is it all right if I stand up?

Yeah.  Well, me too.

It's got to be going better than this..

It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.

No!

Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.

We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

Shi'ites, I think.

But...

Thought you were going to buy a car.

He'll slow down.

A headache?

Naw, nothing.

What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?

What!?

Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.

You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.

Hell, we'll just buy our way out.

Oh, no.

...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.

You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...

Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.

Until we're out of the mine field is how long.

That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.

We make it, or we go back empty handed.

Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

Guess we know what the next stop is.

He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.

Correct.  Origin?

Vocasity

Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.

Eat your dinner.

Now.

I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.

That's not food.  Can't be food.

What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.

No!  Don't go.

I don't want to lose you.

You don't know.  You don't....

No!...No!...

What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....

THX and me.

I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.

It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.

Where is LUH?

I want you for my roommate.

What?

Look more closely.

Too late....stay close.

No......  She's dead THX........

....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.

My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....

You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.

Yes...

Officer Reilly, vice.

You the Bomb Squad?

Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...

Thanks.

When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.

Mike Reilly.

So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?

Anything else I should know?

Hey, look--

Oh yeah? Prove it.

Just how easy is it to build a... device?

Be right back.

Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.

You got it.

Off the scale.

He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.

Don't touch that.

That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...

Easy, guys.  

Call upstairs, see what you can find out.

T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.

We work fast enough for you?

Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 

Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?

Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.

Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.

Thank you.

Nothing... just tired.

What? Nobody, I-

Take him!

You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.

A ticking bomb...

Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.

No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.

Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.

Fuck factor ten.

What?

Captain assigned me to assist you.

He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.

I promised her she'd be safe.

I know.

Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.

And diamonds in the front.

At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.

A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.

<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.

Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.

The type they marry.

Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.

If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?

Yes, Baron.

Yes, Baron.

Yes, Baron?

Yes, Baron. Thank you. 

Just a second.

I hope so, too.

For more than forty years. So Madame told me.

Otherwise I'll call the police

What do you mean?

I know it!

Now just a minute, Major--

No--no.

Why should you?

Thank you.

I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.

Last year? It can't be that long.

And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--

Ah!

Certainly!

Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?

Yes.

I know that niche.

Not particularly.

I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.

Oh! You didn't read it!

Oh!

M'sieu Laval!

Too much blue in crimson.

Yes!

Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?

What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?

How do you like my dress?

Correct!  Good night.

Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?

M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...

Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--

Divine ... But that terrible policeman!

You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!

Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.

How much is your salary?

Thank you, Rose.

A hundred and one next month.

Don't drop it Rose.

Don't you mean work me?

There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.

I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.

The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.

I was tired.

That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.

Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --

I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.

Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!

Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!

If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!

No.

You're crazy.

Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.

You're welcome. Rose.

That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.

That penguin last night, is he one of them?

If only it were that simple.

Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.

Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.

She had beautiful hands.

You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.

Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.

Sure. If you like.

I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.

Sssshh. Come here.

Should I be expecting him anytime soon?

He does landscapes.

Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?

We'll find out.

Get in the boat, Rose.

It's so cold.

Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.

We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.

Well, that's the general idea, my dear.

Charmed, I'm sure.

It's so unfair.

Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.

I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.

This is Miss Marsh.

I can explain--

Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.

--and I can tell you where to get off.

Will you leave me alone?

Glad to see you again.

Sorry I can't return the compliment.

I don't understand.

Montana?

Guess again, copper.

And me coming in with two pair-- 

Want to take it back?

I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>

Yes--

Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.

Well, I can't.

But I'll have cocktails with you.

At seven-thirty?

You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--

Jimmy!

I thought you were a smart guy.

No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.

No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.

Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!

I'll watch for him, sir.

How're the tips?

Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.

I'll take one. 

Get it!

Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

Much better--thank you--

Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--

Why?

Hey!--you're tickling me.

Coming to the pool for a swim?

It's a bet--come on, Sally!

Why, I--

Thanks. That makes us square.

Wait a minute--let's match for it.

Sure.

How?

Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.

Back is in New York.

Send that.

She's in New York.

Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.

It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!

Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.

Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.

No--not much--excepting-- 

No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.

News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--

I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?

I'll never love anybody else.

Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--

What do you mean?

Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.

I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--

Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?

All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?

Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!

Good-night, folks.

Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.

The country boy's about due.

Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.

About twelve hundred.

It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.

Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.

Have you ever figured they might extradite you?

Not a chance--I'm through. 

This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?

Good night!

Thank you.

You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?

500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.

Isn't that a daisy?

Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-

Beauty, ain't he?

And you must be Doc Holliday.

Good.  That's real good.

This brand.

Well... 'bye.

No...

Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.

Better.

Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?

Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.

And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.

Sorry, sorry...

Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.

A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.

What does he want?  He wants revenge.

Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.

All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.

Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.

Awful lot of money.

You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.

What was that all about?

What?

Good God, you're really-

All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!

Colorado's closer

He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.

It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.

Easy now... That mare's in season.

You know you almost got us both Killed back there?

Where do you get these questions?

How would you know?

Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.

I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.

Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth

Fortuitous even.

Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.

Well you'll always be Sadie to me.

I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.

I forgave you the moment you said it.

Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?

Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.

No really, I can stay a while.

Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?

Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.

I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back

No?  Brothers to the bone, right?

So he can tell the story.

They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.

Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.

Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.

Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.

What're you talkin' about?

That didn't sound like thunder.

Will somebody get the damn dog out-

Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.

Yeah.  It's a fact.

Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.

Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-

Jack...

But she doted on the frowner

Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.

Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.

Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...

Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.

Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.

Good-bye, Mister Bond.

Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?

I appreciate your time -

Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.

Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!

Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.

Is this another one of your games?

No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -

Do you?

He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!

Political considerations?

Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -

I see...

If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?

Hey - the world is my office.

Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.

I envy your 'undercover' assignments.

I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.

I hope so.

He was my father's best friend!

The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.

Up.

... We have time for that?

...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.

Now.

I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?

Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.

Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.

Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.

Excellent.

Approaching the first gate.

Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -

No sir! I swear! This is not true!!

I don't know. He's not in the database -

I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.

You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.

Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?

I don't see you crying about my drinking it.

I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...

Babe Brother.

I've heard some foolish things in my life.

Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.

Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.

We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.

Hush.

Hush.

It would be nice.

No, I'm too hot now.

What happened to your hand?

I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.

He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.

I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.

I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.

It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.

'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.

You should go back and rest.

Tolerable well.

You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.

I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.

Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.

Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.

"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."

Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.

Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.

Don't shout!

Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.

Whadda ya think?

Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.

Oh, yeah!

You can bring ONE toy...

No, I haven't seen him.

But Mom, I can't find him!

Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

But what if we leave them behind?

Let's let Molly open one.

Watch yourself!!

Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.

That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!

Where?

Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.

But we're not on my planet, are we?

YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --

Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.

I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!

Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!

Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 

Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.

We've got to get out of here...NOW.

Woody!

Hold still, Buzz!

Not today!

Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!

Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!

Sorry there, old Spudhead.

How 'bout three out of five?

Oh no, Hannah!

Look!  Janie!

Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.

Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!

How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?

That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!

No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!

Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!

Woody?  Who's up there with you?

Yes SIR!

Last present!

Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?

Huh?

Got it.

Excuse me.

I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.

Home is where the heart is.

Get away from me...

Is that all?

Finn -

It was only a mouthful!

So did I.

So had I.

Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?

I can't find Manolo.

He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.

I want to believe you.  I really do.

Arnie, this is crazy.

Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.

It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?

I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.

Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --

Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --

Does this mean you're going to be gone more?

The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.

Not yet.

I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.

We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.

How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.

Will we get invited to the White House?

Yes.

Yeah.

What is this, like freebase?

I feel good.

She ain't in on it.

I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.

Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?

We're playing!

I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?

There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.

Nobody said shit, Eduardo --

You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.

Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.

That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.

They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.

She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.

The police won't find your car.

Then I guess I'm going by myself.

What?

Javier Rodriguez.

It's possible.

Any idea how much?

I have money --

I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.

She hasn't called you?

We sometimes went downtown to score.

You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.

Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.

Agents who died in the field.

What do you mean?

Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --

No. On you go.

Bit fucking late, like.

Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.

You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.

Can you not go yourself.

Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?

For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

It's where I live.

Eh-

Shut up.

No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.

Because it's illegal.

Easy for you to say.

Are you clean?

Too young for what?

Unless you get caught.

Well, he's young and he's healthy.

What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?

It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.

Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --

Oh, really?

Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.

You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.

It's no problem.

No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.

Nightmare.

Lewis Gilbert.

But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.

That's your theory?

It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.

And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.

Fuck you.

It was just an idea.

There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.

Four Grand.

Well, it's up to you.

He knows a lot about Sean Connery.

To see you through the night that lies ahead.

Your favourite dish.

Stick it on my tab.

As you wish.

Yeah.

Such as?

I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.

But where?

No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --

It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.

And how did you breach the Barrier?

You doubt me?

Is there a problem, gentlemen?

Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.

Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.

With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.

The power was within you.

Join my quest.

What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.

I think you gave me too much time, Captain.

Why didn't you beep my communicator?

Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?

Put it on the screen.

Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.

Go, Sulu.

Goodnight, Doctor.

I cannot be certain.

Who is it he reminds you of?

Fascinating.

Yes, Captain?

Captain, what have I done -

If you think it would help.

If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.

Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.

I have a half brother.

The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.

"c."... "k."

Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.

I believe we are witnessing my birth.

I'll take you to the bridge.

I'm afraid of nothing.

Now learn something about yourself.

Am I? We'll see.







"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?

Uhura, I thought you were on leave.

It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-

Do you?

No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.

You haven't told him?

I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.

Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..

Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...

Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...

Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.

You call that getting over it?

I'm certainly not.

Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...

Alan. Alan Bailey.

oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?

So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?

Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.

I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?

I... have come to communicate with my User.

Hah.

Greetings, program...

How about you?

Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really

Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP

We have to talk.

That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.

Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece

You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?

We'll get them, sir... These things take time.

We have to.

I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.

Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...

Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!

I'm shocked.

Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.

Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.

Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.

Yeah, Dad.

Fine.

Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.

Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?

You're kidding.

Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.

And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.

Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*

You want me to just hang-- ?

I'll just hang then, shall I?

It can't be.

I still don't believe it.

Put a tap on her phone.

Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.

Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.

Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.

... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--

Sorry.

But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--

Yes, sir.

That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.

Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.

Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...

I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.

I'll handle it.

It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?

No.

Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.

No.

No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?

The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--

What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.

Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.

What about Juno?

What?

No.  Much more.

Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?

So what's your angle?

What about the husbands?

Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.

Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?

You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?

Go ahead.

No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.

Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.

Something you obviously have a hard time doing!

It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.

I just glances inside.

Find out who this Renquist it.

Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.

Knock wood.

The letter he sent.

Ya looked through it?

Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.

Is that your real name? Really?

I took a cab.

What time is it?

There's nothing to tell.

What do you do?

Would you like a bite of my pie?

Five.

You're not stupid. Just wrong.

Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.

What?

You will?

What?

No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

What?

That rhymes.

Heard that.

You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.

With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?

Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.

Are you kiddin'? He loves you.

Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.

Ask him if he got the letter.

You goin' out?

I certainly hope so.

It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.

Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.

Elliot Blitzer.

The zoo.  What are you waiting for?

Two guys.

Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.

Yeah, let's just get outta here.

I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?

Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

He trusts you?

Sure. I didn't hear anything.

Yeah?

You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.

I can see what you mean.

Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.

I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?

Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.

Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?

That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?

I got some money I can give you -

Sure.

McTeague.

I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?

Step inside.

Absolutely.

Uh-huh.

I believe he believes him.

We talked him into it.

No don't sit here and feed us some shit.

But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -

To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

How the fuck could he know?

Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.

This guy's gonna kill him.

Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.

Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?

No way, Jos.

Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.

Uh, what?

For a man in your position...an opportunity.

This is it, James...what you've been working for.

Shut up!

Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?

It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.

So that...???

I need to go now.

July?!

1995?

Perhaps it was a wrong number...

No more drugs.  Please...

Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?

We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?

And I was in it?  What did I do?

Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!

Jeffrey Mason?

You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.

Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?

James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...

They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.

If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.

No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.

Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.

What's that mean?

You do know me.  You helped me once.

How did you find me?

The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?

You're insane, Jeffrey.

Might be tight.

Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.

I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.

That's 'cause he's dead.

Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.

Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.

What do you want for free?

Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.

Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?

Will be.

It will.

I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.

How much.

One way.

I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.

You Harlin?

'Cause Harlin used to own it.

Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.

I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?

If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?

Twenty-after-ten.

Don't look like nothing.

That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.

Then you ain't gonna have the car.

That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.

What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.

There you go, sweet talking me again.

It is morning.

Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?

You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.

They look nice.

I'm just going to my car.

You sure you can manage?

Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.

I guess I've got wander in my blood.

If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.

A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.

Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.

Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?

From?

I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--

If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .

It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.

Because I know you're full of shit.

I don't know.

I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.

Yeah.  Good thinking.

Funny thing.

Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.

Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.

But I want to say with you,

I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?

Grace!

You closed it, didn't you, Grace?

Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?

I'm her husband.

Yeah, I know.  More careful.

Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.

How do you know if you've never tried?

Just ran into a little trouble.

No.

No.

I was hoping we could talk.

That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.

This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.

For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.

I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.

And tell her what?

I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?

Came close this time and it scares you.

All I have in the world.

There's another reason?  It better be good.

You came to take my wife from me?

Liar.

Christ, Jake, please--

What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.

Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?

What?

That country shit all sounds the same to me.

I've had time to get over it.

Oz.

I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.

Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.

What the hell are you talking about?

Will you shut up!

You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?

'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.

Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.

I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?

You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!

I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!

With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?

Yes, Mr. Vesci.

Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.

Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.

Eh?

But, Senor--

You want something?

You can't do that yourself?

I'm sorry, I didn't--

I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.

All right, old man.  Christ.

I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?

He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?

So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.

So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?

Oh, shit!

I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?

Give it to me!

Who the hell are you?

You broke my nose!

Bobby Cooper.

That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?

Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.

How do you know if you've never tried?

I did?

Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.

Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.

A man doesn't always mean the things he says.

What makes you say that?

And what does that make you?

You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.

No!

Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.

What are you talking about!

Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!

You're too quick for me.

Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...

Yeah, I can fix it.

You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.

Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.

Don't look like nothing.

Another accident?  You got to be more careful.

About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.

Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.

You believe that?

You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.

What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.

Eh?

No trouble at all, really.

Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.

I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.

Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .

Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.

From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.

Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?

No.

Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.

Yeah, I guess you're right.

I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?

Walk away.

If the key's on him, how do we get the key?

After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.

He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...

Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...

But we all need that too. Hold him.

Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.

Harlin's.

And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...

How much?

The ticket is 30.55.

Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.

Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!

Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...

Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.

Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?

Yes.

Four.

I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.

He's asleep.

I haven't been sick this year. I know that.

That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?

No that's it.

My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.

Jesus.

Think carefully?

Seventy-five percent.

In college. A car accident.

Is there a problem?

Yes he is.

I want to sleep here tonight.

I won't make any noise.

How much can you lift?

That's great.

Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.

Fine.

How long have you been married?

Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.

I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.

Where is it?

What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?

Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.

Nope.

You don't look nothin' like me, mister.

Three days. Are you hungry?

Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?

Shit and fried eggs.

I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?

No?

You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.

Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.

Yup.

I didn't hear nothin' till last night.

You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 

What's your name?

"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.

Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 

He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.

Is... is it... loaded?

Did you... kill him?

Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.

Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...

No he ain't. He went South yesterday.

Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?

N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.

About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...

L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...

On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.

Well, how about it?

Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.

I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.

Lookin' at?

He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

You missed him? You didn't...?

You ain't shot.

Huh?

Two weeks, I guess.

How far kin you see?

Not for me. I don't touch it no more.

What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...

You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?

We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.

He's blind, for Chri...

Yeah.

How many you killed, Kid?

We don't need him. The two of us could do it.

Maybe.

We'll bury him.

Yeah?

They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze

Bear with me here...

And ?

&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;

They'll never stop.

Alright.

This whole thing was a shakedown.

Then who goes?

The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.

What do you care what he says?

I walked. Ninety days, suspended.

Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at

McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.

You okay?

Well, I'm sorry.

Not if we do it my way.

Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?

Who's Keyser Soze?

Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?

You're lying.

The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.

Someplace else, then.

If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?

I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.

I told the D.A. everything I know.

Keaton was a piece of shit.

What lawyer?

Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.

This is totally irrelevant.

Give a guy a break, huh?

McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.

Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.

But Keaton...

Because he was my friend.

THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.

The district attorney's office will comply provided -

Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.

Nothing.

Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.

... yes.  Get her on the phone ...

... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.

I was her doctor.

...I was one of a group of...

Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?

Just as you are, Sir...

Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.

Nothing further, your Honor.

You may step down.

...one moment, Mr. Concannon...

Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.

I...

You've just said you signed it.

After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...

Hold on a second.

Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...

The Doctors were not negligent.

From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...

Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.

It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

Yes.

You're going to settle out of court?

Why?

Her doctors killed her.

I understand.

Who says that I'm protecting anyone?

Why is that?

I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...

That happens.

I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.

Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?

What?

If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...

No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.

Let me talk to Mickey.

Kathy Price.

Yes.  It was, actually.

And are they going to get it?

I've got to work.

Who told you that?

Is there going to be a later...?

If I don't 'grow up...'

He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...

What do you want?

Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.

...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'

Right.

Right.

So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'

So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.

I think we tried that.  The case is over.

All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?

Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...

But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...

My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...

We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...

In New York?

You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?

Mrs...

Yes...

Yes.

Yes.

She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.

Yes, that's correct.

Yes, the roving nurse...

We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...

Yes.

I married into it.

No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?

That's Carlotta Valdes.

There are things you didn't tell me.

Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?

Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.

Do you live here in the hotel?

0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!

Your name. And --

No, you don't owe me anything.

No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!

No, Ernie's is fine.

To complete my cure.

No! Let me go!

Your accident...

I don't know... Switzerland?

I loved you, Madeleine.

Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!

Where had you been before?

John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.

No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.

Some people prefer it.

Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.

You've nothing to apologize for.

I enjoyed talking to you.

What?

Good-bye.

Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!

I don't like them.

Knowing I have to die...

Only silence. It's always like this.

Here with you.

No!

And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?

A grave...

I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.

And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?

I'm here, I've got you...

No, never!

And it's a all real.

Please let me go.

I won't lose you.

Why?

Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?

What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?

Johnny, the doctors explained --

It's where you belong.

Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.

I've never run across one like that.

Who?

Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.

Do you know him well?

All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?

And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!

Bye-bye!

Oh?

All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.

Oh... this and that.

Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.

What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?

How?

Excellent.

I need a drink.

We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.

What?

First of all...

Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?

Franco mother-fucking Harris!

Why was the floor wet?

Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.

Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.

Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.

You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?

Watch the tone fella.

Any time fat boy!

They're on me. They're smoking me out!

It has worked.

Later.

I know you'll be.  Three hours.

Don't eyeball your kids.

Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?

Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...

The groom?

I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.

Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...

Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...

You always were a jealous man.

What did you ask me?

Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?

Yeah.

Now?

You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.

Fine? Fine what?

You said one in two marriages end in divorce.

Oh really? Starbucks?

And what happens when you can't?

Israel doesn't have a King.

What's your point?

The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.

They need leadership.

You said nobody would miss her.

You will not screw this up.

Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?

We missed the deadline.

Sent it.

You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.

I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.

It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.

David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

Who else?

I've seen it on television.

I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!

So what do we do?

Go down where?

We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.

I will.

Hi.

Okay.

No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.

I'm working on it.

Yeah. You.

No it's not okay. It's not.

Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...

Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.

The prostitute.

It's too late.

She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.

The only proof is those bodies.

You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.

I just want her to be happy.

You're not breathing right?

At the newsstand on 3rd.

The wahoo?

No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.

How do you know she's dead.

Did she believe you?

Yup.

What song?

Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.

I KILLED MY BROTHER!

Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.

What about them?

That one.

Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.

To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...

In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.

You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.

Evil.

Today I can refuse you nothing.

You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.

I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.

Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.

It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.

Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?

Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.

Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.

I think I'd better go tomorrow.

There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.

Where's the dough?

Why did he kill himself?

That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.

I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.

Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!

He couldn't get through the door, then?

Yes!

I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.

Madison lives two blocks from their present location.

I don't know.

Why'd.. .you pull me out?

Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?

Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.

If you can catch him.

You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?

I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?

We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.

You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.

I was assured the problem was corrected.

Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.

This is supposed to be years away.

Show me his physical sensory level.

Then fix it.

True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.

It was me, what?

What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?

I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.

Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.

Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.

Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...

Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...

How did you get your hand out?

I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.

Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.

I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.

I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.

Enjoying yourself?

I'm doing the best I can!

Start of what?

You like baseball?

I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.

Thanks.

A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.

Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.

Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?

You are going after Mayor Bennett.

As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.

At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?

<u>Lure</u> him. 

Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...

I don't think you're gonna need it.

I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?

All we have to do now is sell it to the President.

Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...

...twelve years.

You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 

Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>

...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.

What rig?

Okay.  And she's alleging...?

What in the <u>world</u> would do that?

I'll see you at National.

The American "people"?

Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...

Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.

Why?

It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...

Eight Days To Go 

Anything at the Airport?

...this's <u>good</u>...

Is she saying this in Albanian...?

<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...

I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.

Gloria -- sell the House.  

Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...

Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...

ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.

How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"

Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...

Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."

Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...

When's he coming back...?

And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."

We have some mutual friends in Washington.

Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.

Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

Why Albania?

The... 

Is that true?

...going to War...

It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 

I'm sure they do.

...it's a Teaser!

No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?

President's speech.

No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.

The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.

...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...

"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.

Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....

It's not too <u>clean</u>...

In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...

Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...

Oh, you're gonna love this:

Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?

You do your job right, nobody should notice.

...we'll gettim in their cars.

Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 

Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...

Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?

Why not?

"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."

They'll be here in ten minutes.

...one more day.

Take ten.

Keep Talking....

Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...

Why are they ...

Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh

Leopard Skin...

It's a <u>beret</u>...

...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.

And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?

I believe in you....

John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...

Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...

...they... <u>you</u> know...

Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...

...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?

How 'bout a Cold Drink...?

They don't know what's going on!

Sounds like a french word, what is it?

Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?

...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?

...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.

Anacott Steel. Buy it.

Then get out and close it behind you.

Now! Tell everyone to dump!

Coulda been a contender.

Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.

Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.

Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.

...Work okay?

Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...

... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?

I met them before you were born.

Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...

Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

We are?

Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?

I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...

Jackson, Steinem...

Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.

Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.

...I can't even see it...

...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.

What? How do you know about my father?

'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.

I don't understand.

...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.

I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.

Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...

I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?

Gordon.

Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.

I gather you're a decorator.

And what do you want?

Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.

Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...

...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...

No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.

It's over you, Gordon.

Now tell me, why would I want to do that?

You got it, G.G.

We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?

Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.

A body.  I mean we're talking major body

It's eleven forty-five let's go

Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.

Thank you Jenkins

A party at a waxwork huh?

I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.

That's not what you said last night.

Who's is all this?

Forget her Mark, she's a bitch

So Mark, what's so urgent?

Sell my soul?

I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.

I know he does.

Do you have any idea who she is?

Nope.

I don't know, I'm very confused right now.

You were in an accident?

Just fine.  It's a lovely party.

Almost.

I know how hard it can be sometimes.

Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.

I have to go.

I've never even met you.

What?

I don't know.

I should be going anyway.

This is...

Anyway, Claire slept with him...

She's making this up.

Yep.

Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?

...no...no...no...

The planchette?

Did I?

No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.

Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.

What are you going to do?

I know.

Don't.

Yep.

Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.

We did.

Nope.

Tomorrow.

To make sure she's all right.

But what if something happens?

There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.

Really?

Well, that's nice.

What?

And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--

What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...

Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.

...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.

Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.

Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

Claire, please...

I...

But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--

Stop...

Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.

Who?

...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...

How did she know where it was?

Yep.  There's some great places nearby.

What?

:Well, they are.

But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.

Come.  There is a lot to read

Then you wear it.

When did she die...?

Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -

I under5tand.  All the same

Better than most, I suppose.

It wes a dream...!

You - are - a - murderer.

Michael...  Help us...  The door!

Now, lasher - it is our time.

Anybody got a BP yet...?

FAST.

Always loved you..

I bring her flowers too.

It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.

What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.

I LOVE him!

Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...

Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...

Wrong...?  Science is not magic.

Tell me what I am, Rowan.

It was an accident.   Gifford, too.

No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!

'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..

You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -

Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!

You still feel that crazy...?

Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -

Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...

Hello..

Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.

Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.

Go ahead.

Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.

If you like that type.

Just don't fall off any ladders.

Sut McKinley.  Marry me.

You really love this guy...?

Is that a crack about our singing...?

Papers...?

The one on the left - definitely...

Yes it is...

Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock

I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.

No -it's no problem - I do it all the time

Yes - I have had it for years.

Sure...

my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?

You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 

I have something I have to show you...

It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.

I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.

Did you?

STEPHANIE?

I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...

You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...

But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...

No thanks - 

Why whats wrong with the sugar -

I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE

Yes I can...

No he had to - he's just - he's out...

Get out...

I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...

Poor Freud, turning in his grave.

Cut it out, before you break something!

I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...

Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.

It better not be my Aunt Trudy.

We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.

This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.

Oh, god.  Look. Look.

These are real, live women?

He kicked major ass and you know it.

From your lips, to God's ears.

Yeah?

Yeah?

SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.

So you'll think about it?

So that's a maybe?

I do? I mean, yeah, I do.

Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.

Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.

We own a small family grocery store.

We miss you. We miss our son.

Dad, please.

Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?

Well, why should I?

Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?

I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.

Just say it, Dad.

Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.

Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.

Hi ho, Silver.

I always knew there was more. I felt it.

Whatever you want.

What do you want me to do?

I understand.

But how can you respect yourself if you don't?

I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?

She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.

You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.

Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.

I didn't forget.

From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.

But you triple-dog-dared me.

Your article sucked.

In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.

That's not ENTIRELY true.

Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?

I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.

You never know around here.

I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.

I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.

You've got enough people kissing your ass.

Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.

Eventually you'll let go.

But you never do.

Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...

My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.

Wearing them?  Or humping them?

That's refreshingly deviant.

You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.

Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.

Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?

What is all this? When are you coming home?

Only the best for my mother.

Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.

Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.

Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.

Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.

A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.

Of course I like girls.

As much as possible.

Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.

YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?

Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!

You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.

Me? The King of Coitus?

You think we should be more open minded?

In other words, our scope is too narrow.

Really? So I'm doing OK?

Seriously? I'm doing all right?

We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.

All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.

Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.

It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.

That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.

Kelly.

Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.

What about the blood?

And the child...

I understand.

He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.

She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.

Ray thinks she was murdered.

Back to the land of grownups.

Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.

Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.

The skinny brunette.

Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.

What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...

Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...

You have someplace to be?

Just check out the car.

Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.

We don't know that, Ray...

Where's Lombardo?

He dropped Jimmy off first?

So you were alone.

You know what that will mean for Lombardo.

The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.

You didn't cuff her?

I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?

I said he did.

No!

Yeah, but...

Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...

What brain?

Hi, Mon.

Whichever one I want.

I miss Dad.

Where, the mall?

Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.

Why can't you come...

You think that's wise?

That's cop bullshit.

About what?

Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?

I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...

Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.

But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.

It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...

The bitch shot me, is what happened.

Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.

Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?

Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.

But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.

Can't.  Got a passenger.

What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...

Goodbye, Sandra.

You need that real often?

All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.

Is this leading somewhere?

Prepare what?

Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.

That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.

At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.

No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.

Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.

Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.

I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.

I find most criminals slip up somewhere...

You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.

Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.

You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?

Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.

What?  President Grant is...!

I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!

I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?

Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.

Of course not.

What is this?  A whole new train?

Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!

I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.

Well, I owe you one, don't I?

You tell me.

I've had some practice.

Fine, I'll stop.

Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.

A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?

That'll be all, boys.

On my way to Denver...

Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?

Dr. Loveless?

That would be... the Mexican War?

A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.

It's a smelting retort.

You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.

They're coming.

Right.

He thought you were a woman, Airk!

She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.

No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.

No.  I mean yes.

Let me see it.

Too bad you're not more like your father.

I don't believe you.

Good.  How long will it take?

Are you okay?

These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

I hate this.

I will.

Of course!  I promise!

Where the hell did you come from?

Because she's sick.

You're crazy.  I think you're in love.

Ahhh!

Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!

Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?

Absolutely not.

Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.

I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.

I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?

Why?

Me neither!

Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.

Shut up.

No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!

How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.

Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.

Guess I'm not used to so much.

Pretty much.

Pick up the hat.

No pistol. Ever.

You don't say.

...I want to say a thing.

I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!

Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.

The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.

Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.

A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.

Just us.

Don't try me, Johnny!

Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.

He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.

The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.

Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.

The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.

But you can't.

Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -

Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?

I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.

But... You may not be well enough.

Aren't you? After today?

Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!

Where's my baggy pants?

I didn't even know about it.

Johnny, what the fuck?

Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.

Say again?

I admit I don't know where he is.

What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...

Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.

I have committed no sin.

Yes. Samuel! We're going.

My son is out there!

Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --

Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!

Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.

Oh, I hope we got them in time.

Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.

I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!

Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.

But we've got to verify it legally To see...

If any!

Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.

I don't believe you!

Oh ....

Ohhh!

This?

Hickory!

All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.

That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.

That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.

Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.

The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?

Whenever you wish.

There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.

Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.

My mouth -- my mouth!

...Oh, did that hurt?

Well, you're perfect now.

I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

Oh --

Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?

Lions and tigers and bears!

Yes.

And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.

Not nobody, not nohow!

Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!

Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.

No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.

Did they hurtcha?

Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.

What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?

Oh, well, here -- let me help you.

Ohhhh --

Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!

No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.

But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?

Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!

I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?

Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!

Leave her alone!

Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?

Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!

Imposserous!

Yeah --

I hope your tail holds out. Oh --

Not nohow!

Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?

We do.

A heart --

It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!

I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.

Now, now, don't fret.

I don't know what we'd have done without you.

Go on!

Well, I --

Th.D.?

Help!

Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.

So who are you?

I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.

Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.

We go down to the torpedo bay.

Hes going to insert the plutonium.

But what if...

I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.

The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.

Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.

The worm on the hook again.

Your last chance. Give me the name.

Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.

You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.

Funerals arent exactly memorable.

Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.

Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.

You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.

I know.

Two. Shaken not stirred.

Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?

You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.

Not at that price. Time to surrender.

You turned Renard.

Oh James.

Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.

A rope!

This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!

The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.

What class sub does your nephew run?

Someone will come.

Yes.  Au revoir...

And expensive.  Cost three million plus.

Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...

Still no contact yet.

Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.

Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

Don't call me that.

Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.

Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?

Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.

Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.

Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.

Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.

Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?

Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.

No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.

-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.

What are you up to?

That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

The costumes.  Am I right?

That's because --

What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 

Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.

He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.

Isn't it true that you --

That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --

Am I free to go?

Jon??  You mean he's --

Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.

No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.

Looks like a diner.

Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.

You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.

If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.

Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.

If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.

Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.

I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?

You're a jerk-off, you know that?

Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.

They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.

Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.

You wanna check it out? Come here.

Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.

Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.

The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.

Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.

So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?

If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.

I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.

I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.

It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.

Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.

I thought that was in detail.

You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.

You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.

Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.

I was gonna wait till the islands, but...

Here we go again.

Yeah, thanks a lot.

What's the deal?

Why you dogging me up?

A parachute. This does not argue well.

He's a pretty good actor, though.

It's like you said, every man for himself.

Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.

It'll work faster if I have an account number.

I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...

Of course.

You wanna see my politics?

"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.

You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?

That's alright, I'm kinda tired.

Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.

You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.

Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.

Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.

The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.

We all do.

I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.

For what purpose?

His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.

What's that?

Into the Hudson?

Some cigars.  Case of beer.

Were you now?

Control, Senator...  we teach them control.

This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?

No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.

Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.

We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.

They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?

What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.

The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.

How?

Not at the cost of lives, Max.

What do you want with him?

Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

Poppycock!

Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.

Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.

What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?

Baack!

MMMmmmm.

MMmmm.

Yes, don't worry.

Very....very!

Goodbye, darling.

Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.

You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.

Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.

This is the only library I know of.

I think you must be mistaken, sir.

Will there be anything else?

This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.

A week.  Ten days at most.

But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?

How old are you, young man?

I'm sure we will.

What?

What?

'How I Did It.'  Good title!

Tonight?

Don't fall for that one.

You can say that again.

You're just supposed to repeat what you said.

What did you find out?

Can you play it?

What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?

Is everything ready?

MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!

Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................

...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................

It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?

That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?

Yes!  What could it be at this hour?

Well, this explains the music.

I think you've done it, master.

Stop -- singing!!!

Good night!

Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?

Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.

Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.

Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!

Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....

One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!

Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.

Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.

Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.

Thank you.

Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.

Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
