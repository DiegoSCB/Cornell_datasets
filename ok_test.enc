Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes.
Where did he keep his money?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Of course it is.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Please, not on my account.
Doing what?
We'll find you a hotel.
Hallo, Peter.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
What are you doing in here?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
On the street where you live.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Nothing. Good night.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
I think it's funny.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
I get all your CDs.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Hi honey.
Not much further.
Who is she Daddy?
Did you warn her?
She's not here.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No.
Really?
Why?
You gave me a 'D'.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Yes.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
You ok?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
I heard you got attacked.
You know I want to go with you.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
My dad's down there!
Mom?
Did he say anything else about her?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Unfair?!
Where's Sam?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...moron.
Uh, huh?
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
What did I say?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
All right, then how about this?
...up.

...town. 
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
...-damn!

Okay!  All right!
...-er!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Holy shit...
...up!
Come on, old...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Get over!  Get over!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Come on...
Whoo!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
...ho!

 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
He's crazy!
You're--?  What?!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.

...did you?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...

...deal with this asshole.

Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!


Arlo!
Oh, shit.
...tunnel!
Mason.

What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What'd you come back for?!
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
...us.
No.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
We've got it...

They were all wearing hardware.
Yes, sir.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
"I am become Death, the...
No!
...about--
No, go--
...-ple.
Mm-hm.
...always done, Richard?
All right.  After they put you away...

I can't say it's a surprise.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.


Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him again.
This was supposed to be a...
Shit.
Dennis!
What about these two?
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...gear?
....-lene.
Doc...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.


 



No.


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...it.
 Two pots of coffee...
Uh, we both like to fish.
Video lock.
Rangers.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And only then does our noble friend realize...
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
...you, Mason?
Mason.  Mason!
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
You find yourself wearing a...
...to talk, son.
I said let me see your hands now!
  All right.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No.
Just find the girl.
How do you do that?
Of course I do. Where are you?
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Thanks, Lou.
Congratulations.
Looking for someone.
What are you doing here?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I know what he says.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Mr. Gittes.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
What?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Hold still. Why?
Where are you going?
I know.
Yes.
I can't...
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Oh my goodness.
There's just one question.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
He never even kids about it.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Neither do I.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
What are you doing here?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Yes. I want proof.
Now what can you see?
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Father, I have sinned...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
So what'd they say?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Who else did you see?
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
What's happened?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
But, Mr. Kane -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Yes, Mr. Kane.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
Emily!
I know it is, Brad -
Oh yes, there is.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Oh!
A chicken?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I mean in New York.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
You goin', Mom?
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
All right.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
What's this?
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Thompson!
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
How long have you been smoking?
Thanks. Have a good one.
I think you'd better leave now.
Dick.
So where is he?
Am I missing something here?
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
I'm not pregnant.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I'm giving him his ring back.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
You work in a market, all right.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Then who operated the store?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Like you're better!
That's easy to say from over here.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
You only brought one ball?!
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
That's what I said.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
All four?
Empire.
What's that?
Yeah.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
What's he looking for?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Vermont?
Don't yell at me, pal.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
What!?
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I can't close the store.
Shut the hell up.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Her fucking body fell out!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
Hey, what about Veronica?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Lovely story.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
To say the least.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
You used to go out with her?
Be careful.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
You're trusting.
I was kidding.
Three?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Why do you call him that?
You sucked that guy's dick?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
What is it?
What did he say?
A couple...?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
I'm not out of shape!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Is he staying here?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I think the lady called it.
I beg your pardon!
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
And... he told you all of this?
I... I don't know what to say.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Dental School.
I have first dibs.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
Willam!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
C-4?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
I'm coming out!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Two...
Do you see them yet?
That's a virtue isn't it?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't understand?
Excuse me?
A flare up...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Let's be creative.
Remember the first time we came up here?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
What about you?!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
He'll freeze.
What's he doing?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
He never hurt anybody.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
What's your names?
On top of the peak.
Right.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Get off my back, Qualen!
This way.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
You got what we need?
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Help you.
So this is the young man?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
What job and how much?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
What do I want?
Yes sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
How are you feeling today?
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. What do you want?
Fucking hell...
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
You like Bach?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
You like being a lawyer?
You need a vacation.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Max, the cab driver!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...he's two floors below you.
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
What?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Something going on?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
I never bought that.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
What if they're wrong?
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
It's home.
You on some kind of work plan?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Got it?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
You listening to me?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I don't know any Rwandans.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
So what?
Another collateral.
Collateral damage.
Let him go, Vincent.
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
How long have you been a hit man?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Who's Heller?
Yeah, that.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
As in...? 
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow the hell down!
What happened?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You going to warn him?
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
People do have heart attacks.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So why are they after you?
You okay?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who are you, Jerry?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Did you see the van back there?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
You will?
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
Now what?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
How did you know?
I love you, too.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
And you feel bad for it?
And you have no idea where he lives?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Jonas?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
That you come with me.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope there's a cartoon.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What...
What?
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Dr. Cullers?
Can't we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Could we hear to the moon?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Am I one... or many?
You live here.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
Why don't you come back with me?
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
The V.L.A.?
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
You sonofabitch.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What...?
Ellie, what is it?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
But --
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah.
No.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go hard!
We saw the broads.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Somebody say somethin'?
Whatta you so happy about?
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Luke. Where you goin?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Who are you?
I never hurt nobody...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
She's supposed to have it.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
We'll show that to...
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
What's that siren?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
Who's the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Are you always so bold?
He was in my apartment!
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Answer it.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
There was no sperm.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Oh, maaaaan?!
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Where you going?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Detective Niccoletti?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
It's about time.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
You're kidding.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
How?
Really?
How can I help?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Yes.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
For a price.
A small price.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Tell me all.
Where to?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Not yet.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
What is it? Are you OK?
What?
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess we need to talk.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
What are we going to do?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
Sure. Why?
Are you all right?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Agent Hadley.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
They left about a half hour ago.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Why are you here?
And?
They're gonna be what?
Uh, no --
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And for my help I would get what?
I only have your word for that.
For what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bring me the scissors.
I thought they came with batteries.
That moron.
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
It's not?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
Why haven't you turned us in?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Everything.
And the other car?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
The map said to go left.
What do we do?
No, I didn't.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
They don't serve wine here.
This kind.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about Canada?
Going somewhere?
-- I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
And how do we do that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
She seems pleasant enough.
Who are you?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Do you think you are a real master?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Hello.  What is your name?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Please sit.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Give it back!
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Don't send me back!
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
What was it?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What happened?
Save your strength.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I don't know...
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Mom --?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Neither.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You'll be alone.
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
We've got company.
I've got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
I'm Kathryn.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
You promise not to say anything?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Oh really?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
You're naked.
Need a lift?
And that's a bad thing?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
I'm... I'm alright.
Okay?
What are you reading?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Those are my letters!
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
What are you saying?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Who is it?
What do you mean?!
It's like a secret society.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Positive.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Sorry.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You would not believe what--
What's wrong with you?
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Any day now.
You amaze me.
Shut up.
Morning!
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
What about her?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oh, hello.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
What song, dear?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Where did you get this ring?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You're shouting at me.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I've wanted a friend.
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Can't you get it, darling?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
May I pet the deer?
You?
But why?
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I like stories.
Mommy read it to ne.
Hurry, hurry.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Jennifer?
Translation: a total geek.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Can't you get contacts?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Why would they exaggerate?
What the hell is the tampon test?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
What happened to his tooth?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
What the fuck are we going to do?
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
I'm cleaning my stove.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
About Benito.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
You don't have to pee.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Wow.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Uh.... hi!
You had a date with Carlton?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
You at least owe me the truth.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
No, I have a cat.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
It's for you. Frida.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
How the hell is that your business?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
What kind of animal?
They don't speak English...
Police.  Nobody move.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Please, they'll kill me...
What is this place?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Dammit!
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Where are we going?
Why give yourself up?
I don't know who they are.
Don't know that either.
Where do you think this goes?
What now?
You see it?
Where does it lead?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
Water?
If you like.
Horrible...
It's a trick.
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What the hell is this?
.. Nothing.
Just don't call him, Alan!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Nobody's got clean kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
What do you mean by that?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
In the car.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Presence.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
And it's proving quite effective...
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You're not?
Really?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
I was waiting for that jack.
Who?
Well...
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
That was quite a thing you did today.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
Where are you going?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
That's a secret.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
Well I guess...
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
What is it?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Sir. It's quite clear that...
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
This stuff really works? No shit?
Dios mia.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
It's been fired.
Tricks...Jesus...
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
Yeah.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yeah?  Like what?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
Well, sure!
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Yes sir.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Where are you going?
But father, it's not fair.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
Want to come to the study group?
What?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Put more into it!
They are...they are everywhere.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Who gives a shit about aft?
What other bunch?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
Noooo!
You don't have to be so touchy.
I'm not rich people.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
The "come back" kind.
It's not them...it's it...
You want ME to go up there?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What was that?
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked us both.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Who's full of shit?
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
What the --!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
I got delayed. I --
You're back.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
No, I --
I have to go.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You like to call me Linda now?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Where's it gone?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
How's the trailer?
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Nick?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You can do it, Sal.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Is he from here?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
What are you, hoping?
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
How's Linda?
I like it, Nick.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Don't worry what it says in the book.
What's that noise?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Well, who'd you get married to?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Speak up.
Give it to me.
Hello Wade.
I'm wasting time.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Just great.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
You okay?
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
You sure?  I can help you.
You my partner?
I'm ready.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Yeah.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
You want to be a good detective?
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
What's this?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You okay?
I just heard.
You should be in hospital.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Seat's too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
Jabez -- ?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
What's that, sir?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Say ... about the interest ...
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Stevens!
Now run along, Daniel.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
No, no! Give it to me!
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
But Jabez, I never said that!
Mary! Come back ...
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
Hello, Sheriff.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
You mean -- a jury trial?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
Hans, he killed by brother --
Bad for your health anyway.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
John!
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah?  What's the odds?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
You'll be okay.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It looks like a whole roast.
What guns?
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Denmark?  Sweden?
Would you do something for me? Please?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... yeah!
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
You try calling the police?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
Yeah.
Who's this?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
You frisk me.
He wanted to kill me!
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
What the hell you doin' back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
I must of been outta my mind.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Where's the back door?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
I didn't eat any pizza.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Did you always call him Junior.
I used to, but I stopped.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
We won't have to.
He wants one.
To show that we're negotiating.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

Sal?
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Oh - Maria!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
We can't stay here.
Not now, Mom, please.
Why are you doing this?
Robbing a bank.
Newsman, not ...
And if you can't deliver them?
This is Bishop.
Who the hell is that?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Cunt.
How did you meet Choco?
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
What did he say about the arm?
We're late.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Fast and or furious.
Where is Domino?
You were good.
How you be?
Talk to me.
I'm gonna leave now.
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Mookie.
No, you the man.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Good morning.
Where did you sleep?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Fifty cents.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's dug.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
What?
Feels good.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
Mister Seor Love Daddy is cool.
Whaddup.  Money?
That's the dope.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
You really think so?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Turn it off.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Take it easy, Pop.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Hi.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
HARRY? Are you okay?
What are you wearing?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
H A R R Y...
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Collins is a great man!
These are really cold, huh?
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
No one knows?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
I... found that rock.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Sorry, Charlie.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
TURK, what are you doing here?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
That's my boyfriend.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Sure.
Hey you two. Lights out.
Have you got what I want?
How was that?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Left here! Left!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
You said "aloha" twice.
Times two.
Knock knock.
So what do you keep in there?
Everything?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Yes?
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Do you know this my lady?
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
He knows.
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Will we see a worm?
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
It burns.
Did they try and fail?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
Who are you?  What do you want?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Are you sure this is okay?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
"It is my home."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
And, cut...
Last night was quite a romp.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Wow.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
No!  A horror movie star!
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
But there's plenty of other parts.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
I'm going to my mother's.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Really?!  Well good for you.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Tor, I should be getting home.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
What are you making?
You look beat.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
What was that?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Why... yes.
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What the heck is THIS?!!
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What do you love her or something?
What?!
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
Ed, can I see you a second.
Uh-huh?
Yeah?
Leave her be.
Ed --
He's who we want to go with.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Where are you going?
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
No.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
How's Marcia? She all right?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Yes.
Both.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Hi. Is Shari here?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Yeah...
Why do it?
Oh my God.
Go!
Oh God, this is so weird.
So...?
Everybody hates me!
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Twenty-nine.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
What's up?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Show business.
You would do this? You would actually --
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
All right.
Polish acrobat.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Hi, Shari.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Tu
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
what?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
How'd it go?
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
What?
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Looks good to me.
NO, that's fine
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
So what brings you here?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I don't believe you.
More this way.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
points at the motel.
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
What?
These are private -- these are for us.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
How's the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Captain, what do you want?
Will you work for me?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Where are we going?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Dudley's guys.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
She's fine.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
Ed, I want confessions.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
What's on the call sheet?
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
How about White?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I'll take your word for it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
My daughter was a virgin!
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Really?  How?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
DePinto's dead.
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'll come straight there.
It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Same thing?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
That's fine.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Remain calm.
Your stuff?
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
He's got his priorities?
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I know, but listen--
I know.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
It's really over?
My suitcase--
What can I do for you?
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
And then what?
Do you like fish?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I know.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
This conversation's over.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
It's okay to use the phone.
No, but they took my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
I don't know. I mean--
Jerry--
You gotta--
I'm sorry, man.
Tell me about it.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
What is it you want?
It means who's side are you on?
What?
The originals?
Who?
We'd have to--
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Yes sir.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Yes?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
You felt obliged to.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Actually, you sing.
When were you most happy?
When were you least happy?
What do you hate most?
I can still taste you.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
It's so cold.
Oh dear.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Good morning!
I was talking about the girl.
I believe I'm rather late.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Is this you?
Or was it Toronto?
What do you want?
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Right.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Excuse me -
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
For my hair?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's what I've learned.
Hello.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Yessir.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Meaning--
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
I have a question...
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You have a car?
Seems I am.
I've got something...
I didn't expect you to be so...
Do you mind?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
The Empress Death Mask.
I know.
And good morning.
I know it well.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Let's do it again.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
I trust it's your size.
You were afraid of heights?
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Your share.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
So how long till we do this?
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
Put this on!
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
My friend, you always surprise me.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Cause of the chromium.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
I can put them in a good school.
And get someone to help around the house.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
What are you doing here?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
This is the only thing you found?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
What do you mean?
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
And if you had to guess ...
Ho - ly - shit.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Who's the judge?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
And you were told to destroy those?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
You come to the right place.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
What's going on in there?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Which number do you want, George?
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You're around every afternoon?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
You are someone.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
More than you need me.
Thank you.
And I miss you.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
What?
Dr. Paulsen?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Oh.  Oh.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
... Luke, you must not go.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for someone.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Mine, mine.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
What are you so grouchy about?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
You don't look angry.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
They're moving away.
What are you afraid of?
There's something out there!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I was worried about you.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
How's your mining operation going?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
What about Han?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
What's going on?
What'd you say?
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
Closer?!
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
I can't. It's too big.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
They're my friends.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Did you call the Zoo?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Who's that?
Ooww!
I tried...
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Give it to me.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up, Plissken.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Defense against what?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
Locked.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Got a smoke?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Where are they going?
Not yet.
Later.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Yield. I have the advantage.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
I want to thank you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
What is this place, Merlin?
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why can't you be my champion?
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Why?
Why didn't he kill us?
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It is.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
You are truly magnificent!
You provoke me, Merlin.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Now you must pay me.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
No, he's working on another book.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
And you got an invitation.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Oh, I see.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
No. No rats.
There is nothing.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Morning.
A stimulant.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
She used those words?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
On what?
Oh yeah, since when?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Is she gonna die?
What kind of stuff?
Oh look at that.
Hey, where'd this come from?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
People get tired.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
I believe you.
She seemed fine.
Another one. Had your lunch?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Really?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes
How old are you?
Is there someone inside you?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Give me the keys!
Frankie.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
What's our friend's problem?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
Oh my God ...
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
What's wrong with it?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
You're their uncle.
What d'ya got?,
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
We gotta go, Jack.
You gotta go.
I made her nervous.
Yeah?
Nice, huh?
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Awe inspiring.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Day.  Wednesday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
You saw wrong.
Expensive hangover.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
What do you mean?
We're not getting paid then.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Right.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
You're an hour and a half late.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
So?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Right.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Jack, you with us?
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
He's right.
I don't believe it.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Hey, we're connected.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
How come?
Brought it.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
It went well tonight.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Where's egghead?
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
What'd I say?
You're upset.
You were good.
Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Vegetables.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Guess they're up.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
So. How are you?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
So?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
How is he?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Which ear was it?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What -- what are you doing?
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Clarissa left those here.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
What about me?
Just following your example.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What is with you tonight?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
I'm going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Her assistant?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Mr. Mintz.
Thats right. And auto supply...
Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
Damn...
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
She is relentless.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Miss me, Jack?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Finger food...?
Evelyn, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Uh...that babys crying...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Thanks, Jack...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
How can you do that?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Good things...
I could stay here forever...
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Annie goes to a great school.
Youre not married, are you?
Mrs. Peterson.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
Thats totally see through...
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Are you alright?
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
He's not responsive --
This is wrong in so many ways.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
And where do we think we're going?
I though we went over this.
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Front page?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
<u>Ben</u> did this?
But I'm not done with the machine --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
What?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Okay to proceed.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
I know that. But what's the maximum?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Listen...the Heart.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Doctor...
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isn't possible.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
At this size, I would certainly think so.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
What's wrong, Skipper?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
...Is this a fucking joke?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
We need more -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Any others?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, don't be silly.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
You're not a C student.
...Yah, okay...
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
but do you know that for sure without -
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah!
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
...Well, that passed.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You look in his citation book?
Yah?
Yah, that's a good one.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
No, that's okay.
...What can I get ya?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Nope.
Hello?
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
They announced it?
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
And his wife?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
I'm tellin' ya.
There's no one else here.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Is that your blood?
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
It means it was homemade.
You need to lighten up.
We need to talk.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
And I saw you practicing this...
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
What are you doing here?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Where?  Here?
Here.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
He's not here.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
Marla...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Insurance'll cover it.
I don't... think so.
Yeah.
Thank you.
What's that?
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
I know that.
Same here.
Where's your car?
What are you reading?
Unbelievable, huh?
Promise you won't.
Huh?
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
I feel sick.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
What are you talking about?
"Applicant?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Is this really news to you?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
One minute.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Please...
What?
Why... why... why... ?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Would you rather be dead?
Yeah, how?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What do you want me to do?
No!  It can't be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I tried calling last night but your father --
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
This is cheery.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
That's why I was there last night.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
And don't pass on the right.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
It broke!
Knock it off!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Batteries not included.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
I've seen worse places.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You never been in one of those things.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Why's that?
Why'd they want us?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Yes you can.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's the job?
Where?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
Typical...
How long have you been setting up?
Black.  No sugar.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Will it hurt?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>What</u>!
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Hello....congratulations.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What do you think?
What?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Parry?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Your name was picked.
Now what?
Oh, Lydia!
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
Have I died?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Parry.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
I'm not married.
Why did you do that?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
But I gave it to you!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Don't say that.
I don't drink coffee...
No.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Now, now.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I know you're not.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Come on.
Sure you don't want anything?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Well...
Hey, mack!
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
You want me to hold the chicken.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
No.
Daddy's very ill.
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
Do you want some gingerbread?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
Nothing.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
That'll make you happy.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, I wouldn't.
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Who are you?
Yo.
Remember me, from the pool?
So what you think of me?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
The one with the phat ass?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
So what do you want with her anyway?
How do I know you're not lying.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
I wasn't asking.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
So where do you know Alan from?
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
For sure?
My pleasure.
Can I get you something?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Are you serious?
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
And what was that?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Has he?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Why are they after you?
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
That's Brazil.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Alan Stanwyk.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
I have the same problem with my help.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Will you kill me?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
What is this....
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
No wonder.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I have some ideas.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
You wish.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're saying you need money.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
What an interface!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
It's red, Ford.
You okay?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Are you okay?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ford, you were right!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I tried to help you...!
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Like me.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
What's fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Well, hello, Ford.
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
So...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Got a wife named Angie.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Well try, okay?
Sal --
What's your name, asshole?
What?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Le sommes nous?
Sale boulot.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Where's he from?
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Why not?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
The greaser with the blonde.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
What happened to you?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
It was a crematorium.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
You okay, man?
You give him his drops?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
I swear, Satch.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Okay, start pedaling.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What'd you say your name was?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What the hell...
What's going on?
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
You sound...ground up...?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What are you talking about?
What?
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Are you alright"?
Whatta you mean...
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What do I tell them?
Whatta we do now?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
She makes ten.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Got a minute?
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how'd you like LION KING?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Are you a good cop, John?
Hell-
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
You're all just jealous.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I don't know.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What are we gonna do?
This is no time to celebrate!
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
There...Ya happy?
Why?
Okay, give it back.
Where'd you get this?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Yes!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Steven buggin' you?
That's very colorful, chief.
Tell me!
Wanna know how I did that?
How many times do you want to hear this?
I've told you the truth.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
That's disgusting.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
You have no right...
What are you doing??
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I...I can't...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
So, are you having fun yet?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
Yes...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Crosstown.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
But didn't we know it would happen?
It's just a review.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
See, Daddy.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
And you've been extremely patient.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Alma Wetzel.
This could be it!
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
What do you want me to do?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
A grandmother. God bless you.
You're a family man, Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
What do you mean?
And he has finer moments now and then.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You're a clergyman.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
We need your help!
They're sparing no one, I see.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Perhaps some tea?
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
You almost sound like you believe that.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Suit yourself.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Again?
Everybody goes there.
I have your samples ready.
Anything I've forgotten?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Vincent...Vincent...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Yeah.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
So you didn't do it after all.
What happened?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What is it?
I've got enough here.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
What about them?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You okay?
Feel good?
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
Where did you get them developed?
Half a million.
You been okay?
That's not all of it.
You go out much?
It's just been a while.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
They checked in.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do you trust him?
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Yeah.
He must have.
You've got it all figured.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
You can't trust anything these days.
Okay?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Things can't get much worse can they?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
What now?
Where's home?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Two.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Where we go in1?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Let's just get to the border.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You do what he says, Harold.
A couple of weeks back.
What do you want?
What's it got to do with you?
Well, he drove it into the river.
I made a mistake.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Really.
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Do you?
Yes. I met him last year.
How'd you know where I'd be?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
That's why you waited for me.
Then he must have pulled her.
Oh, what you doing now?
You all right now?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
It just would. He was always the same.
See you later.
What happened to you, then?
I'm staying with a friend.
Will this do?
What'll they do to him?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What about Keith?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Not suede boots!
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Four hundred?
I'll see you, then.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It is.
You're on this...
And it's not right to the customers.
That's right?
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
Who?
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
The nurses?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
How many leads have we got?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
We're just "talking" about it.
No.
You didn't?
Is that what I said?
A job with Graff.
Oh, yes, George.
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
Why?
You need money?  Is that the...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
Clear...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
I am?
He said he filed...
The cops?
Why don't you think so?
Yes.
Thieves.
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Who used to say that?
Who told you...?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
The people downtown said...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Would you come in here, please?
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
John.  John...
I'm not sure I have two.
Can't do it.
Why?
What happened?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Yes.  I hear you.
Why I don't...
You robbed the office.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What?
Don't.
Why?
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Shelly...!
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
You closed 'em today?
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
What?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Yeah.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Monday.
Who did she call?
When did you write the check?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
No.  She told me "right now."
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
No, Jim.
What...?
What?
Fuckin' asshole.
You hear what I said?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They got, listen to me...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Why do you have to go?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What took so long?
Bought at the airport.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Goddamn bitch.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
That's off now.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it, where were you?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
Me too, Tom?
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
It might show.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
You're right.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
What the hell are you talking about?
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
No, I meant lose his family.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
I know.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
On the phone?
He don't want to talk?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What if I say shove it?
You want a war?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Thanks, doll.
What makes you say that?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
What're you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Then you're as single as I am.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
No.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
I never thought you were.
Ah.  A philosopher.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
No.  The girl.
Is that --?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Just take off the fucking mask!
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
You okay?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
She is horrible.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Get out of here, Ray --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You have my word...
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What's this -- ?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
You mean the poor --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Forget that ...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
You look good...
What are you doing back?
Why didn't you tell me?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
I heard you were pumping gas -
Nah. It's a scratch.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
What happened to you?
You?
You?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Having fun, Kip?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
What are you doing here?
Where'd you find this one?
You boost her -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
Call 911 -
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
Buy you a drink?
On account of Mitch?
I do ... I cut "em...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
This time it's for real?
Some crew you got ...
You need him...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Give'm a drink.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
I gotta go home.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
I hate to do dishes.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She didn't do it again did she?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
How's the woman?
What?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Why didn't you yoke him?
Okay.
Hi.
--That isn't funny--
WILL!
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Holy shit.
What'd you say about me?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
What class did you say that was?
How'd you like that course?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
--That edge!
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Get out, Will.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Yes.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Hello.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Why me?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Jobs doing what?
--And confuse him--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
He won't be a failure!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
So I hear you're taking some time.
Do you know when you'll be back?
About thirty million to one.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Yeah, I read those.
That must have taken you a long time.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
I just want you to know, Sean...
No. Thank you.
You suck.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
No I haven't...
Yeah.
How many?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Come with me to California.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
You doin' the hirin'?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Lots must a died, too.
Maybe the road's out.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
I didn't see nothin'.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Excuse me for asking.
And you ain't ashamed?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
They're all gone--or dead.
Think she'll hold?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
But we can still do it, honey.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
How about a lift, mister?
Been doin' a job?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
What is it?
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Which ones?
Tommy?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
You mean get off my own land?
How you get all this money?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Morning.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
What do you do?
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
What's your business?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
You're fucking psycho.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
I was leaving.
You went to school with these people.
Like a union?
Is that right?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
This is not good.
I bought a new rug.
What's a revival tent?
So what happened to you?
God it's great to see you.
I have to get my head back into my work.
This is Annie MacLean.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
What?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Thanks.
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Show me again.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Yeah?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did he mention it?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Who's going to want me now?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
How's everything?
It's me.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Aw... that's so sweet.
How was the dinner?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What did he say?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
- See, what you can do for him --...
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Isn't it like, obvious?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
It's warmer than I thought.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Jude, you okay?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
You want to watch some television?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Long enough.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Shit!
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Damn!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Yeah?
And what's he do?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
What the hell are you doing?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Make it our first date.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
Shit!!
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
You're welcome.
There's a new virus in the database.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Any questions?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
A hacker planted the virus.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
I'll take you down there.
So?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Brady!
Brady!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
Why not?
Because the lights are all out.
Yes.
Night Doc.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
It's been eleven months.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Had enough?
Jamie!
Rachel!
We'll hear sirens soon.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Hi Rachel.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
132 to 133 this is 134.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
When he makes that call.
Is that him? Is that him?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
How's it powered?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Hello?
Sure, see you later.
Probably Mister Riddle.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You idiot!
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
A man wouldn't do that...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Sure...
They could be.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Is Annie around?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Not any more.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Who is it?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Hello.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
There's nothing else I can do.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Thorazin.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I see.
Pull up to the entrance!
...any sister talk?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
We're a big hit.
Oh!
Oh, geez, yeah.
Uh...
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
What?
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
We could...we could do that.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Hi.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
How's everything?
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Are you?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
...or films you must see or... 
I don't sell my work by the yard!
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
But you don't have any symptoms!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
You're just realizing this now?
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Hey!
Okay, okay.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
What?  You're kidding!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Oh, gosh.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You treat me like a loser.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Can we, can we go?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
I'd never do that.
People change...you know.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Nobody ever said it.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
No, the reason I ask is--
No, I haven't.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
I can't think.
A reward...
Well.  Word gets around.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Yes?
Why me?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
You're ready now.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
First things first.
Where was the call from.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Look at this:
No. 
I am all attention.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waal...
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Of course, Commendatore...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Who does not?
I require...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.... yes...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
You were given backup....
No, I don't get you...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...I'm sorry....?
...which of us is free...?
Look what they put her on...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Fine, thank you, but
I am on the track of...
Ask me when we get home.
Hello....?
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Tell me why...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Howdy Pouty.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yeah. I guess I do.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
God, you're beautiful.

How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
You stupid cunt!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Where did you get these?
What do you want from me?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Do you take German?
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
We killed them, didn't we?
Your son's dead and you love him.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
You know what I want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Answer him dick!
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
You two....
Turn that back on!
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
He's the manager!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
My name is Gina!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
To be known as He!
Him.
I shall call him Diello.
I think I'm going crazy.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
But that's not true! I've got one.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
No.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
I have my connections
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Who's Allison?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Kirsty... Kirsty?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wait... what the hell is this...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
The bathroom!  For two days?
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Bill, I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
He waited for you three hours!
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
I snuck in.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, er... I...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
You were... very... inspiring.
It's not right, Gale...
"A little mistake"!
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's the matter?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Give it here, Bernard.
Where are these toys of yours?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Do you have a family?
You must value your independence.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
I found a cent!
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Have you just plain asked him?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Thank God.
Whew.
Honey --
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
We're going to think about it.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh God.
Just reduced.
It's fun.
Are we gonna buy this house?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Neil, do you mind?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Do you see a man?
Really?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What do you think?
Tough.
He had to come from somewhere.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Then take me with you.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
You stayed here again last night?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Talley.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Who sent you?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
You got something to say?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
What do you want?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
We can't carry him.
What do you want?
Kevin left without you.
Smith!  Wake up!
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Where are they?
What's wrong with the radio?
He says that his father's hurt.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
What's my name?
The kids are in here!
Can you open them?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
Marlon and Al....
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
What happened?
Ten.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Excuse me, Colonel.
I don't understand.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
We are better here.
I led no massacres.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Let's go.
Satellite feed.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Lets go, Jock.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Who did you call?
What do you want?
The commander is not here.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Any luck?
Has Roger spoken yet?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I will not leave without the twins.
Please, please try one more time.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Rutaganda's place?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
I don't know.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- bullshit --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Oh, for chrissake --
More the merrier.
Melissa!
Oh, really: who?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
'Less the place really is haunted.
What's in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Is she...alright?
Why not?
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Good point.
Price!!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
I'm ready now.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
I think...I may have the answer.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Vannacutt!!
What is it??
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
I'll take my chances.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Please! I need your help.
It works.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
And you think it's in there?
Pritchett: what is going on?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Town records are coming up now.
It will heal.
What do these ingredients mean?
Well then who did?!
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
H-how long will it take?
What's he doing daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
What the hell is that?
Who?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
You don't think I know?
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
You must be a Londrigan.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
What was she afraid of?
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Something bad.
Wha .... ?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
But I don't know what's going on.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
JP?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Really?
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Alex, are you....
My life is not some deal.  I...
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Way to go, Anna.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Don't be stupid...they...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Something short.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
That smart?!
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Hungry, anyway.
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Smitty.
...Certain people are --
...Huh?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
What a beautiful thought.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Oh, Norville --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Muncie.
You can't print that!
Terrific.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Awwww, buddy --
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
...You don't?
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Geez, I --
Yessir.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...education, were you?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Finally.
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
Good morning, miss.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
I'd love to.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
The West Indies?
But it's so far away...
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I told you.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
What about her?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Benjie!
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
What do you think?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I... I think I am...
If you're going to insult me --
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Elena.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
I'm fine dad.
Grades?
Huh?
Dad stop it!
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Hi mom.
Mikey Williams?
Oh.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Shit. You're not planning --
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
No one.
Where you going?
Did you tell Sandy?
Wow!
You get in trouble?
Her name's Libbets.
Hood residence.
And?
All my model planes.
Want a drink?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I love you.
Nice kid.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Duggar called him?
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
What about your shoulder?
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We're sure it's hers?
Forget your pager?
That's right.
That's right.
He's asking everybody questions.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
You heard me that time.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Since grade school.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
My arm!
She used some stupid code name.
You gave her gifts.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Monstrous.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
What are we?
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
I'm not your daughter.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Stop pestering me then!
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
I want more.
Why does he call you that?
You... fed on me?
It can't be -
She's no vampire.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What do you want from me?
Diane!!!!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
Why do you do this Lestat?
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved Yvette...
You loved your wife, surely.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Lestat escaped the fire!
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Yes.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Say yes.
No means yes.
That could break the machine.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
What do you mean?
Ray, I can't...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Never do that again.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
You sure?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why are you doing this to me?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Oooh, the mainland --
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Ahh, that feels great.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
He leave you?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Take this.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Where's Thea?
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
Woman, what are you doing here?
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
What is her illness?
This girl --
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
George . . .
Good morning, sir.
Go through with what?
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
What'd you say?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Clarence . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Hey, who's that?
A boy?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
You sent for me, sir?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
What boat you sailing on?
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Yes, you bet.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hey, George . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Holy mackerel!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no.
If I told you it might not come true.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
After that, who cares?
Have fun.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Where're you going?
Oh, George, George, George.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
You can?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
It's okay, it's okay....
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
No.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
Coming up!
You coming up on him?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
Mike's out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
What else is there to do?
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Wait a minute....
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The what?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Eat Cheerios.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
No.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
That you were fired.
I'll give notice.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Bullshit.
Martin, it could be anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hi Dad.
It killed her.  It ate her.
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
Get a dance yet?
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Give me back my hat!
Mmmmmm.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I don't care.
You're going sailing.
Wave to my son.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
He's going with you, Doctor.
I'll need more men to look.
What's your plan, Brody?
Sure am.
Well, not much longer to go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
My imagination isn't that good.
Damn it!
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
You're going down there again?
After what happened to us?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Finally.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
It's too soon to move him.
Honey, what is it?
Come on.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Come on!
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I want that shark alive.
Let's hope he knows that.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
Philip.
He's big as a bloody bus!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Isn't this fun!
No...  It can't be.
Gotta sneeze.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
I'll go with you.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
That's impossible.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
You'll spoil her.
How come it's my responsibility?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
I see what you're doing....
Yes!
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
I want you to give up your work....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
It got him....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I don't know how....
It's just like driving a car....
You're impossible....
How do you like flying?
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Hurry!
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Yeah....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
They won't fight with me....
Bad boy....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I invited you...
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure you've done this before?
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Shove it....
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
All the time....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
Cow tipping?
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Did you bring it with you?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What time is it?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Where is everyone?
I haven't got it.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
You believe me, don't you?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Jesus. What are you doin?
Now?
Listen, you don't havta come?
How do you know her hair's black?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Yes, Sir.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
Sorry?
You know? How do you know?
Why can't I stay with you?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
What does that mean?
You think he still loves her?
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Listen to me!
Didn't hear it.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Don't let him stay up too late.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Can I help?
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, thanks.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
... light.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Truth?
Well.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
If I said that, would you stay?
Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Forgot your keys --
I'm sorry, I --
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
At last I find you.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
You are not allowed to act this way.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, tell the story.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
You gonna get that --
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I won't tell.
I don't see any.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Her new boyfriend.
You hate to swim.
No, Dr. Grant says...
What did you say?
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
It's not safe.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Where's Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Absolutely not.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
How would you classify it?
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
We need to head for the coast.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Amanda!
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Any damage?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
I'm not going, John.
Oh --
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Where do you think you're going?!
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What is?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
What?
Come on!
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
You've got to be kidding.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
But would we get the phones back?
You shouldn't use my name.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
There you are.  Out you come.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Carousel.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Why would they care what we think?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
So what are you thinking?
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Ellie, com one!!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
I'm going with you.
Come on, let's go.
It's all right.
That's right.  Will break through.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Oh, imperfections?
Alan?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Why not?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Tim.
These look kind of familiar.
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
Go, go, go, jump!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
What'd I touch?!
Yeah, they hate me.
Hey, we were saving that!
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Tim!  Lex!
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Go away!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Well?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Other guy?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
It's still on.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Oh?
Fascinating.
Uh-huh...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
You know how to use one of those?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Fine -- terrible.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
It's what I'm paid to do.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Eduard --
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
... A piece of paper ...
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
It's gone out so quickly?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Man Eater!!!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
They were just tasting the berries.
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Did you fear for your life?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Why? She's a junkie.
Mm.
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
What was better? I made better bait?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Well do you think it was him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could --
You said it was!
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
How can you do it to yourself?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Where, how?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Well --
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Well?
Think this is our guy?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
What does?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Greatest.
Show.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
Mom, I mean dad...
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Wow!
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
What did you do when you were little?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
I don't recall.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Wow!
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
'Night, Jim.
What the hell is this?
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
And?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
What?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
John?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You ever think about getting married again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Where are you from?
Mama, my story.
Not the way to talk to people.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Did you receive the letter?
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Holiness?
Me. First break of day.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Do I have money?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Has anyone died?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Me?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
What do you think?
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
You have grown up very good.
Tell me.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Hmm.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We are here on official business.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
What's that?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
I can arrest you!!
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Where is he?!
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
You're gonna be okay.
Kelly Scott.
How big do the bears get?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Hector!!
You sure?  I don't mind...
If I'm ever in New York...
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
We set?
I'm ready when you are.
What's that?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
This is a little different.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You're sort of a rude person.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
What?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
<u>You</u>?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
"- every day."
You're all right! Where is he?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
What would it take?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I am, yes.
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
And the questionnaire...?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Two months.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
So you ran away...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Yes... I did.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Are you alright?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Why didn't you bury those people?
He did?
The Ottawa are gone.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
My letter...
One called Magua arrived.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
That is the truth!
And if we're unlucky?
Any powder?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
What a place for them...
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Yes.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Such as...?
My colors?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Be careful with it.
It's got Hazy!
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
No way...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Where the hell've you been?
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
Sixpack?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
They know, don't they?
What are you doing?
We're on backup air.
We made it!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
How do you feel, DeJesus?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yes sir...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I'll kill him!
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
They were going to pay, then?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
It's not him, Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

Yeah, one of them's out.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well, what's going on?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That you, boy?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Go on.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
You would take a pain n the arse full stop.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I don't know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
That makes it okay?
And what did she do?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Who's "they"?
Please.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
Skinny?
Nice job.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Whole different story; isn't it?
You look good--
Suppose not.
350 pounds.
Come on in--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I have a B average.
How's your room shaping up?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Cliff--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Mikey--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
That where he was shot?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
This girl is a friend of yours?
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He still living?
Besides my father, I mean.
Morning, Hollis.
I got an idea what happened.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Right. When he was killed.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Mom?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
How come?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Your mother still doesn't like me.
People liked him.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
I should get back.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Yeah?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
We start from scratch--
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
You going to tell her?
Hello, L.A.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
You ever been married?
Why?
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's Butterfield...
Thanks, Billy.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Death.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
I was so afraid.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
No!  No!  No!
... they believe you.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Why'd you come here?
Are you satisfied now?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Him too.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Are they all in the business?
Oh yeah?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
... no...
That's where we're all going.
One question.
Yes! Yes!
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
I'm thinking about it.
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
I don't remember.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
What happened to your toe?
It's bad isn't it?
Do you know where we are?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Lydia?
I don't know.
You know, eat healthier.
Not all that pasta.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
I guess she's busy.
Hello?
Great.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
I don't know what to do.
See you later.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
John! What are you doing here?
It's amazing  there!
Uh..thanks.
You never said anything to me...
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Yes.
Seemed...on edge.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
You'll do it?
He spoke to you?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Oh my God!
Yes... and you are?
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I'll bet.
So...what did you think of the tape.
So what'd I miss?
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
And the point is?
Peter, let go of the chair!
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
It's useless...look at him.
Good of you to stop by.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
What's the matter with you?
Thanks for handling this.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Monica, what did you do?
I hate it.
That's not funny
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Engaged.
Whatever.
There you go.
No I don't.
That's not it.
What are you talking about?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
What?
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I don't know sometimes.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
And he's fine, girl.
What's up?
Thanks.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
You ever think about going back?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
See you made it.
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Why?
What was that about?
Forget Tonya Randall.
Then prove her wrong.
That was so weak.
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
I won.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
You weren't at my game.
We're going to get some food.
Least you got your priorities straight.
You're what?
So that's it, just forget about us?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
So...how's the knee?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Like what?
You asked me what was missing.
Give it yourself.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Yeah.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Whose truth are you talking about?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You work too hard, Pop.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Why?
What's Mom think?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I ain't a damn liar.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
What do you want?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You smell like trouble --
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
What kind of Cancer?
My mother had breast cancer.
Don't sit down.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
Yes.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yeah.
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
The gentleman who came to the door --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Great, bye.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
So you've done it --
Why not?
You really use strong language.
It's fine.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I lost my gun.
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Just say no.
What's your name?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
What?
Not enough, what do you want?
Can you hold it?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
What happend, what's going on?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
DAD --
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Do you have love in your heart?
....do you know who I am?
That's right.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
You don't need braces.
I've been a good worker --
...ah...
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
Do me a personal favor --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
I think you have the wrong number.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- just to clarify --
This isn't meant --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Where are you from originally?
Why does that sound silly?
I wouldn'tve asked --
Do you have your masters?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Kind of.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
It's interesting.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
There's no disturbance.
I didn't do anything.
You on any medication?
Will you say my name?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
What happend to you?
You want her right now?
What were you saying, Stanley?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do.
I'm sorry.
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
What does that mean?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Pink Dot.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Be ready at two --
You ready to keep winning?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
...what...?
No, M'lady.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it, mother?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
How is he?
Three days.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
A simple theological discussion.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Forgiveness.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Coming?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Silence!  I order you!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Where is Michelle?
Food, moron.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Did you hit him?
Find out for me.
I'll take the south end -
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where is he?!!
And what did you do?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Holy shit -
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Are you a regular there?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Where am I going?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Is it weird?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Who is it?
When are you coming back?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Where the hell's Graham!
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Reba...
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
'No' what?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
Linda King's desk.
Okay.
He's misunderstood.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Do you remember what you said?
Can you quit?
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Lt. Fisk said...
Will it keep them out?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Are you gonna kill him?
She got all right?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Pray tell.
I don't believe in God.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Sitcom...?
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Andy?
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
We were just trying to push the envelope --
So how can I help you...?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Tony Clifton.
I can't move my arm.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
B-but I have them.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
What do you mean?
Hi...
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
And all this will be for real?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Hey Andy, good show.
Give me the book.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
"Philosophically"?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
We had a deal!!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Can I help you with something?
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Don't be ridiculous.
You don't, do you?
Did you hear that?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
Give me your phone.
How long?
Hello?
Holy fucking shit!
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Why not?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Why do my eyes hurt?
This isn't real?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
Do you know why you didn't make it?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Hello, Neo.
Of what?
Who is?
Uh-oh...
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
What is it?
Go!
What?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Are you all right?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
Hey, come on...
Drinks for everybody Tony...
What happened to you Flash?
It's the truth, I swear.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Hey...you got nothing here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Michael, give us a lift.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
You getting out too?
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
You're really crazy.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Bore.
Take your time.  I don't care.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You mean it's heisted.
How much?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Look who's talking.
Have you got a minute?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
What, honey?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Who's Annie?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Honey, please.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Yeah, but --
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
What are you eating.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
We have an arrangement now.
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
It's going to be great --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
That's it?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
And what do I get?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Yeah.
Can't, sistah.
Not time yet.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Don' need you okayin'.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
Oh goodness, no.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
How long have you been standing there?
Where are you going?
Thank you.
I like you in a black tie.
'Love will find out the way'?
What a good idea.
No --
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
What's it like where I'm going?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I couldn't sleep.
And I don't give a shit.
Uh --
What the hell do you care?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Okay.
I told you to shut up.
You are --?
Yes.
You want me to be your guide --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Yes' what?
What are you talking about?
Where are you?
Get what?
I'm sorry --
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Aw, you're tough.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
You're terrible.
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
That was wonderful.
Where's Joe?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Nothing lasts.
Why?
47.
Should I wear it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
You don't know?
What makes you think he's my friend?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Where'd you get it?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Is that what your little note says?
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
How do I know he did that to you?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Neither do I.
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Yes.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Lenny, is that you?
Things change.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You're living.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
What do you mean "bad news"?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How do you know him?
What's wrong?
This is a drug deal?!
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
My wife wasn't diabetic.
It is now.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Bullshit.							*
We know these people...!
Oh, yeah...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Where's the new drop point...?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
We're not certain...
So...?
My end?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
We want it back.
The Keys?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Were you born in Havana?
How's he not your husband?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
Good samba dancing...?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Hola, chica.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Is this the protective male talk?
...in the morning.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
Packaging?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
What do we got?
Verdado where?
Go ahead.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
Yeah...?
They had me from the gate.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Why?
Equipment?
Then what were we talking to you for?
This the load you lost a while back?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
You think I'm lying!
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
For money.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
What's in your socks?
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You don't seem like no fag...
What for?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
They wrong?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Thanks, Joe.
What you got me up here for?
I'm going to Florida.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
You really want to do business?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
'Figgers.
Years?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Dad...I'm...
Where you staying, Dad?
How far?
No, I'm not afraid.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
How's it feel?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
You got your stuff?
What?
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Billy, what's the matter?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Know what?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Peter...
The Department of Public Health...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Its muscles are locked.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
But the power...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Which way?
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
It worked before...
Hello.
What?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
It bit you.
My God.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
But what?
Pretty rough so far.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
Thank you so much.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Done?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
See, isn't this nice?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
It'll only take a second.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
You've been out of your room.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
What was the top bid?
What you got there, mate?
Before we kill her or cure her..
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What are you doing here?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Now how to get in there.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
To friends.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
That's S.O.P..
Only four more cars.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
You were in the car!
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
What are you going to do?
May I come in?
I didn't say that.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Go ahead.
No sir.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
What?
I don't quite follow you.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
On what?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Mm - Hmmm...
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Merci.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Give me the God damn gum.
Higher.  Higher.
The package is in the open.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought I'd take some now.
I guess.
You're going to use Walter?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whats going to make him do that?
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
You got it.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Jim, its over.
What's going on?
Thirty-two and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Whats the problem.
Who's dead?
You're welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Where's Ma?
I'm getting married.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Mona?
You're my father.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
Where'd Johnny find you?
When you get engaged?
Why you talking to me?
Your blood.
It's so bright.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You don't get along with anybody!
Who painted that?
This is your place.
He's coming.
No, I'll tell him.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You don't want the fish.
What's the matter?
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
What about the wedding?
Have you told her we're getting married?
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Will you live here?
How's the mother?
Did he tell her?
No. But I have a hangover.
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
So.
My mother's recovered.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Can I get another one of these?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Nerves.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
That's my house.
I don't know.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
Burn them.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
King of the WHO?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, how did you become king, then?
All right!  What do you want?
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'll do you for that.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What with?
What?
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Gosh - Is he all right?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
But, Father.
How?
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes ...  make sure ...
The Castle Anthrax?
Camelot ...
Quick!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Bravely ran away, away.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
What?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
What's your name?
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mama...
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You sent for me.
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
They're ready now.
What is it, John?  John?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Ma'am?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
We're going to lose.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Unwell?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
Why not?
Ma'am?
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What do you mean by "weird"?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Where do we go?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is that?!
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
So start at the beginning...
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
So what's the problem?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
Yes...what is it?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Wow!
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
No, no, I'm fine.
Can you tell me what happened?
I think I've been hurt.
No.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Don't stop!
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
To my audition.
Wally Brown.
No, we don't.
Yes, Sir.
You're so easy.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
You see what I mean...
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Palmdale.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Not here...no thanks.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
McCay knows ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
I don't get it.
Just stop it. End it here.
What are you DOING here ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When you are ready.
You did.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
What's next ?
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Really ? On a date ?
Are you okay ?
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
This is California, anything is possible.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Okay, no problem.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Seriously.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
I don't know if I want to.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Maybe he's wet?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
And she saved it.
Do you have any pictures if her?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Hi.
That's okay.
My mother can't have any more kids.
Hi.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Getting off please.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I think it's cool.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Does it work?
Uh oh...
...I dropped it.
Where are you going???
Hey look!
Right.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
No?
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
A secret, I like that.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
I think this place is just fine.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Something wrong?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
Arthur!!
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Wanna play?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Ex...ex, ex...
It's there.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
Dad??
Are they ready yet?
What are you doing.
Why not?
Did I kill my mother?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Hi.
Sure.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Really?
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
He won't give it to me.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
I'm hemorrhaging.
Oh great!
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Do you remember her?
Heaven.
Sorry.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Can we go yet?
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
I dunno..
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like this?
Close your eyes.
Say something it's too quiet.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
You don't miss much.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
I've lost interest.
We'll never be the same.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Zit cream?
Neosporin?
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
Excuse me?
What else did he tell you...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
I've been calling for days!
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
She's too genuine.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
I'm up against a deadline.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
What's up?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Lower.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
You got the money?
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
What?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You're from out of town?
Barnett?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You bet.
Yes.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
What?
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He has that sign with the tree.
It's on National television, Barnett.
You want anything?  A drink?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Okay.
President?
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
He's my father.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
What?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
What's this?
Who's that?
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
What kind?
I feel really good.
Fungus?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
When did you start singing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
I don't know who you are.
What?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
I'm twenty-eight
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Premeditated murder.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
You know who that is?
They said go see the chaplain.
What time?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
What National TV...?
I mean...
We just got a gold record.
Probably a little too long.
Pleasure
Oh --
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You think it will?
More or less.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Who's the song bird?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Sorry about that.
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Describe Mallory.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
And they made the first move?
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
How's it working, Scotty?
It's gonna be beautiful.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
They done that too long in my family.
Where' you goin'?
Boy - you hear me?!
'You Duff Anderson?
Want to keep your job, boy?
I know.
Walker and Williams.
And his age?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
You working?
My father's the preacher.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
They must work on the section gang.
How come you stay 'round here?
What d'you mean?
Surprised?
Hi.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What about him?
My kids want me to teach them.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't look so scared.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Hi.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
You heard me!
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Where're you going to go?
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
That's right.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Come on, Pop.
Going back, huh?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
No. Why?
Let's stay here, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
He's your son.
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
How long's it been?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Take this off.
What about her?
What are you doing in here?
What you lookin' for, mon?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
You've got your orders.
Tell me the words.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
What are you talkin' about?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Where did you here that?
Case... are you okay?
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What about before that?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
It sounds like you.
Case... Are you alright?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
No Roger from op/ed?
Forget it.
Senorita Josie.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
Wings?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
How many times have I fired her?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Gus?
That's your story!
Oh my god.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
You're twenty-three years old!
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I love the way she writes.
So what are you thinking for college?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Are you--scared?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I'm alone.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
I don't know.
Aloha! Welcome!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Wow - I-
He <u>has</u> to know...
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
Uh-huh.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
You two got a thing going, or what?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You mean a shithead.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Here.
You want to talk about it?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Morning.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
You're going out?
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Horseshit.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
You like gymnastics?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
What are these, beauty marks?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
Who is he?
My God.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
No!
And then I... right.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Are you busy tonight?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
If that's all right.
Floppy, huh?
So who left who?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
Why?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Yup.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
What?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is certainly... ah...
I thought I'd give it to you.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Excuse me.
No.  Not true...
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Is this your first film?
Da Vinci?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I agree.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
That's right -- Topol.
Martin -- your customer.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Well?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Right.  No one else?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
And yet you suspect her.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
On this ward?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
You men remain seated!
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What's your name, buddy?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
In ya go...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
Wait a minute...
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
What for?
There they are!
It's the questions she asks.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Okay, sucker.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Don't you have any clubs?
Why not?
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Hear what?
Who told you that?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Oh, what's that?
Poker!
How are you feeling?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You look pretty healthy to me.
You think it's funny, huh?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Got a cigarette?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
A dime.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Please follow me.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
How 'bout twenty?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
She was your sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Excuse me?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
So, what's the story with your friend?
No, really.  What's she doing?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
You're limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
Why not?
Why?
Mickey Spillane.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Nice dress.
So were you.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Yes.  I am.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Come on, it's not so bad.
It's a miracle.
It's still the new year...
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
A phone message.  Only--
Your brother?
What's that supposed to mean?...
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Amazing...
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
You said they was only going to talk to him.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Mmhmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
See! You don't understand!
It was you, Charley... .
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
I think we're O.K.
I want to be a teacher.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Were you really a prize fighter?
Terry!
Why, Terry, who said it was?
His racket?
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Edie...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry, no, no... .
Every one of 'em... .
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
This is my business.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Who asked him here?
You all right, Nolan?
You still call it ratting?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
So help me God!
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I think you could have.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Better.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You ought to go home and take care of that
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
Listen Nolan
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
What do you mean?
What can we do?
The ropes are coming loose.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
All right.  Put it on heavy.
...And what is this?
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
The moon is almost gone!
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
I want to speak with you, please.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You didn't visit him in prison.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Ask him his name.
I'm not dressed.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Do we need him?
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
And she saw you?
You find out?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
They look like plain old rocks.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
We made it, didn't we?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Leave it where it is.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Who?
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You don't act like it.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
Don't leave me.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You're not dumb.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
Looks like tonight.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Have they got Midge up there?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You busted out?
There were others.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You there?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
I can tell.
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Technically.  They're separated.
Can we change the subject?
He doesn't even look like that.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I wish she could forget him.
Nervous?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Good shooting, Danny!
How could you do this?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Then why are you looking for her?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
They're all over us!
I got a half a tank.  You?
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
How often you fight like this?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
I don't get it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
What's the matter?
We're here on the sofa bed...
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Right. I promised my mother.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Are you for real?
Terry! Slow down.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
You think so?
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Hi, Dad.
Quiet today?
Yes.
He'll win.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
Who was that man?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
And the butter.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
What a great kite.
Okay. I promise.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
I was building a doggy door.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
So where're we going?
What's his name?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Aren't you giving an exam?
Don't apologize for me.
Jerk... What did you say?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Fuck you.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
I'm not going to die.
Whatever.
I know that, Charles.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Innocuous?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
I buy that.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Who'd you get?
Rayisha.
How did they find out?
I've considered that.
A regular all-American guy?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
What do you love about it?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Thanks for coming by.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
Do you take risks?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Some do. I didn't.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Mom?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
In what way?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Great.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Lots.
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Let's continue.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Oh, Lord....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Power cells.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Back to the ship, huh?
What, you're afraid?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Little ratty-ass.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
This does not help us, Johns.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
King Tut's tomb....
Very big beads.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Think about that reward, Johns.
Well, what's it look like now?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What's her name, anyway?
Dr. Zaius --
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
As you wish.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
You didn't think so then.
Geiger counter?
Which direction?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
We got off at the wrong stop.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Gorilla hunters ...
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Thats a lie!
What about me?
No.
Of course.
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
It's humiliating.
Would you like to come along?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Do you believe him?
...but 'Lias is still out there.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Sarge?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Come on you can do better than that!
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
...beautiful night.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
And you, do you believe?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
They might think I was running away from something.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Bad?
What time is it?
Cold?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
They're going to arrest me.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If you're doing all this just for me.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Would I want to?
Yes, Miss.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I'm sorry.
FLorida?
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
If I understand what you meant by that.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I expected nothing else.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
And without much discrimination.
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Information.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What do you want?
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Send that?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Right.
Not too hard, is it?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
No suicide.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
He checks too.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
No.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
So-so.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
What's this?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you she's just..
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To Ann.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
How's Mary?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
What period?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
You're so famous now.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
What's this?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
You never were...
Yeah?  What?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
What do you want?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
Nice place.
Meaning you were expendable.
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Those are cold.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
My name's Johnny Utah!
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Thanks.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Where the hell is his body?
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
There's no way you could know that.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
I... I would take advantage of it.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
So do day jobs.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
You're joking.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Uh-huh.
Try a strawberry.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
What do you like?
No?  Why's that?
Not... quite.
Four thousand.
This isn't a date.
Hello?
You liked the guy, though.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Edward, I can't.
What if I lose it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
I got tired of hating my father.
You're packing.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
What time's diner tonight?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Looks slow tonight.
Couple a hours.
Yeah, what?
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
I'm just going to my room.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Brides often are, I'm told.
Who are you?
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
He knows I do not love him.
Rest, Highness.
You mock my pain!
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
What?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Yes.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- anything you want --
Humiliations galore!
We'll wait until you're ready.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You are wonderful!
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Yes.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
You're just stalling now.
What's so funny?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
You feeling any better?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Assume away!
What do you mean?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What scheme?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Where would you like to eat?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
What kind now, Leo?
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
What are you doing?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Maybe it's not true!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Max, I...
Don't help me.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
But he has long hair!
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
What did you tell the people?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
No. At least I don't recall.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
I live there. Alone.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
Now, look...!
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Let's all talk about Mary.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
I'm Mary's sister.
Here?
What should I know?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Where... can I stay?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Sorry.
What?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
For what?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Dirty night.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I imagine so.
You go out... with friends?
You should... mind it.
Why don't you go away?
You're not going to... to your room already?
Phoenix?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
No, m'am.
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
May I see your license?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I'll get your bags.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
My mother is not dead!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Yes, why?
But what about lunch?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiance. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
That's the way I feel about it.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Are you giving me this straight?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What!
No kiddin'?
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
I told you he was a sore.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Why?
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
What is it? What happened?
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
But I have some friends waiting.
What are you laughing at?
Yep. Everything settled.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
Could be.
Dysfunctional --
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Actually, I am, though.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
There goes Mother.
He kissed her.
She's putting the titty back.
What's goin' on?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Is her husband sick or something?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Of course.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She does look a little peaky.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, sir.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, it was a silly question.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Galley what?
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
I see. Outside it.
Um-m, well...
Yes, dear, what is it?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Oh, no, ma'am.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Never again, never again...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
You think it's that good?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Kittle...
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
What'd I say?
You shouldn't litter.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
"A.D."
Wh... what... ?!
It doesn't say that.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
You live like a pig.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
He tried to kill us.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
How'd we do?
We're screwed.
This shit was Ming.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
I can't do it, Ben.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear, my Master.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Luke.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
What are you telling them?
Proper?!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
If that is your destiny.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
You!
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh....Say something.
Right!
Hello.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What a guy
What guy
Want to come again and stay
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
...How's the turtle food this week?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
What's funny?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Would ya like a glass of water?
D'you really wanna call?
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
...T-thank you.
I always knew you was pretty.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
...And he called the reporters --
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Owe you what?
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
I don't like ya face.
Kiss my ass.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
This a con?
Cost ya a buck.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, would you be interested in --
What?
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
More like thirty.
Rice is a bum.
What's happened is freak luck.
Fifty years, huh.
Please, kid.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Hey --
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Why?
I got whiskey here.
You ballin' her?
To see ya train.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
So altruistic.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
So where is it?
Now what?
What the hell is that?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
When will I hear from you?
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
How do you know that?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
[Within] Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
I have.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
Meaning, to court'sy.
I will follow you.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Do you have it?
Of course.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
What is?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Do I need to repeat myself?
I still am.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
Where's the case?
And more importantly --
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Sent it where?
Gregor, is that you?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
A means to an end, is that it?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
So what is it you want to know?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
It's been known to happen.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Cigarette?
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
What's going on?
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
How did you know?
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Do we need anything else?
Not here.  They might see it.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Let's get him out of here...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What's the story?
Why didn't you kill her?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I've got one condition.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
That's not what I mean.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
And how do you figure we do that?
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
It's gonna be o.k.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
How are ya?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
What's wrong?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I don't know, Booth.
Why does that bother you?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Sally, do you love me?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Test the product?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
A lot of men come in here?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I'll settle for a third of that.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Don't hurt me.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
You think he skipped town?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Invitation, please.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
What?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
You bring American money?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
Hello.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
Not Yu.  You!
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Who?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He'll be back soon.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
I wouldn't do that!!!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Ricky Tan is alive.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
What is this?
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
First class.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
You move well.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Master Ching taught me.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You talk very fast.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
It's the same thing!
-- what the hell is that?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Are you OK?
Want some?
What?!
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Oh no.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Any demands yet?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
You don't understand this guy.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Really?
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Maggie!
Or a vegetarian?
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Give me that!
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
Too much.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
You were not.
I'm listening.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Grandma!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
What are you talking about?
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
It's not true, but it feels true.
What's with you?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
What?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
What?
I love you, too.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
Becky?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
It's probably just the flowers --
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
You know.
Magic.  It was magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
It's been about a year and a half.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Is he home right now?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
It is not --
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
What?!
What?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Did you call that radio station again?
Everyone at work heard you.
Did too.
Yes?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Oh.
I read an article about this ...
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Was it expensive, the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What's the matter?
A fighter, huh?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
How do you feel?
Where are you going?
When?
You mean you're ready to give up?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Where's your mama?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Ramn ... listen for the love of God ...
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Bobby?
What can I do for you?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
You don't understand.
Why don't you call the cops?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
What do you want from me, Colette?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
I'm kind of busy.
We been through that.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
How you holding up?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Where to?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
What?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
What's this?
What the hell is that?
What?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You want to do this some other time?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
You don't find that repugnant?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What? Is it bad?
Danny?
This the guy?
Turns out he's connected.
The Mexicali Boys
He knows somebody ratted him.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
He's the only one I told.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Excuse me?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
When is the deal going down?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
You think that's a good idea?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
We're in business.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Yep.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
He ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Where?
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
How about that jeep?
That only leaves three.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You think they'll be alright?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Oh, yeah?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What are we going to do?
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
What deal?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Who cares?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
How fast?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
This evening is over.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Thanks, I like yours too.
C'mon, just do it.
Alright.
What does it say?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
I'll put this past my boss
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hello.
Mom, please?
This is me telling you about me.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.
Well...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
So it's an honor?
So we can finally talk?
Thank-you.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Oh.
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Yes.
Yeah.  With potential.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
You told your dad?
Then don't do it.
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
Okay.
You're freaking out here man.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
PAIN!
The guy with the Datsun?
The truck?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
What?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
My car.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Ooop, excuse me.
I was gonna...
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Certainly.
I love you man
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Now you're back.
Well, let's find him.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
You know what, you'd like her.
It's not a charade, all this?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
When?
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
You're not telling me something.
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's wrong with it?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go, I'll see you.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We know that, son.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Hang up...call...
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
WHAAAATT?
I don't think that's a good idea.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
It helped me realize one thing.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
What are you going to do?
But youll never get away with it.
No way.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Two.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Youre the one who got away.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
We had to have financing.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
You have every right to be upset.
I never meant to imply...
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
You broke my heart.
And it's sexier in the dark.
This is all too familiar.
Let's go.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
Hello?
Take it off.
You ass.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
What do you mean?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Please, call me Gale.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What do you mean?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Geez.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Just because you knew her?
But you know my favorite name?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Hello?
No I need to call you. Just you.
How'd you do?
Dude. What are you doing here?
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
You rode your bike out there?
Billy? What the...
Close call.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
You heard me.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
I don't understand...
I don't know.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
I have to go now.
Nah, I don't think so...
What's his name?
...please... no...
...leave me alone... please...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
I was first to respond.
She's tough.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Where is she?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Where is she?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
I'm not here to fight.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Where do you get this shit?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Are you alone in the house?
Can you see me right now?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Have a good trip.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Yeah.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
No way.
TATUM!
You don't.  It goes to court now.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
I don't believe it.
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You should be thanking me.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I... I don't follow.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
It's too soon for him.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
Well?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
No fingerprints?
What the fuck is that?
He just may be nuts enough.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Does this make it with you?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
You stupid son of a...
He's preaching.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You know he's fucking us.
Well... what the fuck, man?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Throw your gun down now!
Tell me it's not true.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Anything... anything missing or different.
Are you absolutely certain?
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
You got any more orders, Captain?
I didn't give any order to fire!
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
I say NO!
What in...?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Unnt-meah!
Ay-eh...They was here...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
I beg your pardon?
Yes, sir.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
Futterman?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Well, you're a widower now...
They'll be back...
What's that got to do with us?
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Comancheros...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I have to cut his windpipe...
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Cherry-red Tears.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
No, I've never seen him before.
And that is?
Mrs. Straub!
What?
Ohwhat have I done?
Follow that boat!
Thank you, my lady!
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We have no Juliet!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Are you writing?
How much?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
No, your marriage bed.
This time we take your boots off!
But nothing is happening.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
What happened to Sam?
Do you know it?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
I feel a scene coming on.
Will! Have you finished?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are lost.
How will it?
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
The daughter of his enemy.
As a nurse.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
I would not for the world!
Like you, I found him not at home!
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Nono.
"thou need'st not to be gone."
My lady Viola.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
But what of Lord Wessex?
"Poet?"
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Only on expenses.
Alex, I don't have the time --
You mean immoral.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
No, not that.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I won't be able to.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
How much?
What is this?
I want to secure it.
Who?
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Well?
Are you recording it?
Well, is it?
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Cameron.
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
Did you know --
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
You want me to kick it open?
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
Hello. Hello.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
We have to talk.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Interesting.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
No, nothing, sorry.
Of course.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
What do we do here, David?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
What guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
What do you do?
Working nights?
Same as everyone else.
Diseases.
Both, sir.
Offering it for debate.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Do you think George is a fairy?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That's George.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- is that what this is all about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Why not?
I know.
Nummers.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
No, I know.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Then it's not your problem.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
You here to see my mother?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I asked you first.
Yeah, it is.
No shit.
You are.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
You do know what money's like these days.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
... I don't get it done often.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Why not?
George...
Don't do it.
That sounds like me.
-- what?
What's wrong?
Why?
Look about last night --
-- Right after I sprayed her?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Jackie Shawn.
Not yet.
I have to see you.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
You're different.
Honey?
Maybe you don't even like children.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
I already said hello.
George.
When can I talk to you?
When is that?
Never mind. Where've you been?
I know, honey.
Bullshit.
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
-- and take this with you.
I wish you'd go now.
Please!... that's not like you.
Stop it.
It's good you want to do something, George.
Tonight?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Did they have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
You're home.
I'm coming over.
No you won't.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
No.
That's right.
I am? I mean why?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It's been so long I don't how long?
What?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Oh. thank you.
Good for you.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
Thank you.
Everything okay, son?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
No I ain't.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Mommy... Mommy...!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Grady?
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Who?
How?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Beg pardon?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
You mean just leave the hotel?
I don't know.
Yes...
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Only in a very general way.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
I don't believe they did.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Well, obviously some people can be
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Can I tell you kids something?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Went shopping. Why?
Please, Uncle Al.
Are you all right, Marty?
I've been hearing noises in there.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I think I hear it!
You know, I just might!
But I'm fearful!
And I'm tearful!
How are you doing.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
What? 
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
This prom is a real drag.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
HE'S SO FINE.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Hold on.
Two days.  An hour or so.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Soprano or alto?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
JUST SING!
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
We need experience.
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Oh my Lord!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
St. Anne's?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
And all those like you.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
What's wrong with my life?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Sometimes it's not enough!
It never solves anything.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
You sent for me?
What?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
You saved my life.
So I don't shop.
He's a businessman.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I have?
I can't go with you.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Where's who?
We're looking for Mike.
Get her!
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Peace on Earth.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop...
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
It is sacrilege!
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Listen to what you say....
Where are we going?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What now?  Where is she?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
This is farewell.
What now?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
He has proposed to me twice.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
My God... what has happened?
Ichabod...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
She is guilty.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Well, I guess it's all good.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
What's in your bag?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
But maybe just for awhile --
Why'd you live there?
Do you like to play football?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Where'd you get them flowers?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You walk fast, don't you?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Do they know about you?
I'll be.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Thank ye.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
He just got out of the state hospital.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Yes.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Will that be cash or charge?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Not an easy book.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Are you closed?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
A photographer ...
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
I've never seen anything like it.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
You usually get two.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I'm all ears.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
What's this?
For keeps?
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A little. Not much.
Open it.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Let's not get too idealistic.
Celebrate? What for?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I don't know.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Did you say more?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Greedy.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
That's when he fell.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Cigarette?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
You wouldn't even see it move.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
Well...
For certain, no.
Can I say something, here?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Wanna see my driver's license?
I beg your pardon.
Upsy-daisy.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Nellie told us about it.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
Where are we running, Joe?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
DAPHNE?
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
What are you doing?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
What happened?
Me?  After Sugar?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
And where's he going to be?
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
OH!
She sings, too.
Are my seams straight?
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Anything wrong?
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
His yacht?
We don't have to run.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
No!
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
What for?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Another bridesmaid?
We can have it altered.
It doesn't matter.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Anything today?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
We got time off for good behavior.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Bingo?
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Men!
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Why not?
Thanks, honey.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
That must be it.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
Three?
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
What is it?
Look at all that silverware.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Harmless - how?
I don't want to bore you.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Really?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Good evening, sir.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Say something. Please.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Whats going on with you two?
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
You heading to the train station?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Hey, you!
Im sorry?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
Six thousand, right?
Who are they?
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Yes.
Subtle?
Is this for last night?
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Hi.
Oh, no. He told you.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
So whyd you let him go?
Not yet...
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Go on...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
But, Charlie --
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
Mornin', son...
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
What is it, David Lee?
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Is he gon' be gone long?
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Whatcha wanta order?
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
You ready to eat?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't believe he's dead.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
You're late, Cartman!
Your behind?
Mom...
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
You've got a stupid accent too.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Thank God, that sucked ass.
What's going on, Chef?
Viva la Resistance.
Purpre mama!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Who is it?
Guess.
SHIT!
That's gonna take a long time!
That was sweet!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh dear God...
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
Fight the power!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
What if I just left?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Check.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Evening.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
You're certain of that?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Is that clear?
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Look at this...Jesus.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
We're going to die.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Explosive?
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
Take this flare.
And what are you going to do?!
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean?  What happened!
So close...
In that case, I accept.
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
Where's Taylor?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Well now what are we gonna do!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
How is it looking, Mac?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
What's on your mind, Miles?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
What do you think I can do?
Where'd you get this ball?
What the fuck is this?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
Where's Junior?
After we eat, Dad.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Whoa.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
What's plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Do you talk with your mom?
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Very good, busyboy.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Get out of there!
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Thirty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
What for?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
It's not sucking, sir.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Nothing, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
So how do we get it open?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What?
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
They switched us over.
From the sphere?
What is that?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Where'd this come from?
Yeah, it was awful.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
You said something to him, didn't you?
It's not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
He translated it wrong.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Diphenyl parlene.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
What's that?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Did you?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
You're lying --
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Beth!
Beth, stop it!
Beth?
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
You hear that?
How's that?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
When did it come across?
How are you feeling, Norman?
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Norman, where are you?
Beth left?
What is it?
Fine.
Missed.
Hold on.
Well, press something!
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Well, if it's a discharge --
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Norman Johnson.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Are you all right?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Is he afraid of the water?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
You rich kids... are all the same !
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Profile's wrong... there.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Carmen...?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
She's flying starships !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
None at all... We won.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I love you, Carmen.
You're late.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Where'd it come from ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
...CUT OFF !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
<U>Computer off</U>!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
Mr. Spock?
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
They had a pattern to follow...
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Why aren't you on board?
Then you'll be wet.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
I quit.
Why?
You get what you pay for.
But, but but but...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Me?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
...lost the screw...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Hi.
Thank you.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
That's right...
Where you going?
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
No, that's true.
Pelting down out there.
What am I gonna do?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
Drama Group?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Mornin', Doc...
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
Wat...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
How big is this horse?
They think it's your First Wife...
Mornin, sister.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Izzat so?
What's his name?
No.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
Get him on the phone.
That's my...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Hello.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Kiss my ass.
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
And what was it you wanted to say?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
What?
He saw the accident...?
I'm very sorry I...
Not now.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace...
I want to make a good film.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
What's the...
I've got a date.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
<u>Siddown</u>!
You can't write it?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
How do they know that, you told them?
It's lovely.
You cool the broad out?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
<u>Stop</u>...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Mmm.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Zat true?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Ben!  What's wrong?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Well, not exactly s...
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I hope it's the right kind.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I said...
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Hold lunch!
What if he's kidnapped?
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Great.  Big ears, too?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Queen of diamonds.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Mommy's sick, guys.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Okay.  These are good.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
Still, please.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
We don't have any coffee.
What did you do?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Get out!
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I need practice.
However many.  It's not enough.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
I don't know wh...
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Can I look at the pictures?
It's just not the right time t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
Looks nice enough to m...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Not yet.
It's forever you know.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Hey.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Sure!...
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
I can read it to you.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
What do you want?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
What DO you know?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Hello, Vi.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Fuck me hard!
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
That's too bad.
Yeah. But not any more.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You know...I like you.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I'll lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
Let's move it we got company!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Well Filmore--
Are the labs in operation?
Go fuck yourself...
Come on, drink up.
I insist...
Well?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Where the hell could they have gone!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Can I have a glass of water?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you trying to reach him?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Go back to sleep, baby.
General Schmuck?
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Where, sir?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Have you tried the recall again?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
Check.
Roger.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Primary arming switch.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
What's your point, Lothar?
Second safety.
Primary bomb is live.
How do you know he's dead?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Who's that?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Um-hm.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
That was really great.
Uh-huh.
Typical male.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
No, he's not with a girl.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
A long, long, long...
Go!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Sure.
Yeah.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
I know, man.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Your his publicist?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
I'd like to.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Mm.
I'd love to read that.
Can you tell me what happened?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
See ya later.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
You lied to me.
I don't know.
Jeff! Come up here!
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
This is ridiculous!
Jeff. Jeff.
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Oh, yeah?
I've run out of words.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Really?
Now?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
I hope you're happy!
Is that your driver?
Oh!
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Just one?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
What?!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Another sex dream?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
I sure do.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
I know, but that was before.
Madonna.
Shut up.
Oh no...
Yeah?
Really...
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Roll 'em.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
It's from hunger.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
If I could be of any help...
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
With a wildly beating heart.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Hello, Betty.
Her own movie theatre.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
What assistant?
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I wrote that with my heart.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
It's getting kind of late --
There sure is.
You'll like it here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What's that?
What scene?
I need some money right now.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
The other guests?
Hold me tighter.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Go away.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Have one of mine.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
He must be quite a guy.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
You are not dressed properly.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Whose room was this?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
What's the matter, Max?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
We've come for the car.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Paramount studios.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What does it mean?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
A Storm Dragon?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
At last. Ultimate Power.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I'm not mad at you.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
A little.
Oh no, not you again.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Hey, where you going?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Superman will return it.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I can do that.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
There is a way.
You're going to take me back?
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
You look wonderful.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
He really was!
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
You're the best, Lois.
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
How do you do that?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Hey, boss.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Everything.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
I can't! It's out of control!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
I don't kiss.
It could make weather!
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Jimmy, how's the -
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Where were you?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
"They?"
Lois, someday --
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
But . . ..that's terrible!
What??
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I like trees.
This way Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It has everything.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Why?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
What more?
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
He's captured Non!
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Superman? Has something happened to him?
But Superman isn't an average man.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Awesome!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
The one Superman wrecked up?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think he'll find us.
Destroy Superman!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Do you know where you're headed?
I'd like to.
Your bookie?
Hey!
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Oh.
This??
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Nuts. He made it.
Krypton!
Meteorites!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Don't let me down.
You're not going to hit me?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
You got wax in your ears?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Two.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Lois, the kickback story...
Who...who...
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Oh.
It must feel great.
How old are you?
What's the matter, Otis?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Yes.
Ally Jones.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
What...does it turn to?
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Hi, Nicole.
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
Because it's what we have to do.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
I have to.
Because I have to.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
From what?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
What do you mean?
That's right.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
What happened to summer?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
What about Doreen?
What do you mean?
Crafts.
Here we go.
We do.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
You think someone else caused the accident?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
You saw the speedometer?
What do you remember about the accident?
That was great.
Do you like the colour?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Yes.
Will the police do anything to her?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
But of course...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told him that?
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Hello, Harry.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
I know Steve.  No.
How?
He means that much to you...?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
I thought he would.
Bribing me again?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
And where was his wife?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
J.J., if you think -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
You going to work all day?
Radical.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Excellent.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
No!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
John, get out of the way!!
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
You broke my arm!
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
It's finally over.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
How come?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough, tough!
Why were they going to arrest you?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Then you are wrong.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Major.
Yes, you remember.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
One of your people told me.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
And ask him about his private life.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Can you handle it?
Anything else?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
There's so much...
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
What's that?
And so you feel nothing.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
You've got to be kidding.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Don't even think about it.
I'll give you a boost.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
This is C.R.S.
You're the one who started running.
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
Goodnight.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
What did you say?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What do you think you're doing?
They won't...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Julliard, yeah.
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Never better.
You need anything?
Will you?
Do it for YOU.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
What?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Physical?
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
What's this about?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
What?
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
He hasn't called back.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's not going to hold your weight.
Well, this lot is full!
What did it smell like?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Like she smelled it too?
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Why do you need a chain like that?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Theo... Did you?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Nell, what happened?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Not for you, clearly.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
No.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
You should have let me do the talking.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Oh really?  Where you from?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
What more is there.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Didn't get it.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Why did you come here?
What was that, then?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Oh, it just ended, then.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
-- Your employer?
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Of the deal, man.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
She's nice lookin'.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
There is?
Like what.
He's expecting you?
You know her?
Where is he, then?
You've made it ... brighter.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Yes?
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hello, Rachel.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
...I stank, didn't I?
...Mm.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...she can go up there.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
No problem!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
All right.
...Oh, Jesus.
...What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
...What's so damn strange about that?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I don't know what's going on. I--
...Doris--
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
How did you get into the store?
Taking it seriously.
...Probity.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Yeah.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
...You sure, Eddie?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
...We goin'?
Mr...?
Hello!
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Behind you.
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
How big is the sub-basement?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
It's still back there!
What are we talking about here?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
What is it?
Like the claw.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
What's going on?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Come back and get me.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Not that big.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Stop!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Jesus, what is this?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
What was it?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
What happened?
We have to try and draw it off!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Sure she would.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
Where have you been?
What did you want?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Truman, what about that sign?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
How's it going, Truman?
I think you better tell us.
I need your clothes, Byers.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
And if it's unsuccessful?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You follow me out here for a reason?
Who sent you?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You told me you had answers.
You've been using me --
You didn't know my father --
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Mulder...?
Jesus, Mulder...
Had you.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully?
What? What are you talking about?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
This looks like new grass to you?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
And where are they going with it?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Been where?
You hear that?
Where'd they go?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
On whose orders?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
A virus?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
...give a kiss to Edward.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
That went well.
He's mine?
Thank you.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
Is she alright?
You're looking well.
How's the patient.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
We proceed assuming she is.
Den leuten.
You were awfully good.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
H-E-Z-T...
Holly.
I wish I knew.
I'm going back home.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...again.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
How do you know?
Oh, well.
...quarrel?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Where?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
...to him.
Listen, Callaghan.
What the devil?
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
This is where he vanished.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
What time is it?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Welcome?
They wouldn't know me.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What's that?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Striptease, sir.
Very popular, sir.
Listen...
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Dr. Winkel?
Could he have been at all conscious?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...Popescu...
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
The Roumanian?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
A shark fin?
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
What about Moliere?
Bonsoir.
Hi.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Too difficult?
Which is what?
Why no silencer?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Bigger and better.
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
The sex is better.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
No, I think you shouldn't.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
I didn't realize you cared.
Who's Eichmann?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Balint?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
How have things been going?
This will be a different kind of device.
That's all we've got left.
When do you want it to go off?
You remember Miriam....
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Who'd you kill?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Who's this?
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Oh, fuck you...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Good afternoon.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
Where did you two meet?
Is it a poem?
Because you'd laugh.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
Is he alright?  What happened?
What about the shoes?
And where did you say you were from?
What's with the voice?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
No.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... How long was I asleep?
You were right.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
What?
Jacques...?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Why?
Assassin!
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
What are you doing?
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Is he in love with you?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
It could be a man.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
It was you.
Tell me.
What do you do now?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait 
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
And she waited here for him?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
That might depend on where youre going.
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
When did you get back?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
So, what are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Who are you?
I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
Whos the money man?
And who does Friedman work for?
Whats the Ambassador?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
You sure you passed on my message?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
May I...?
What if it is?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Clients come and go.
Where is Friedman?
What is it?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
So why didnt he?
When they realise Im missing...
Mossad?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Jeanne, stop it!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
No, but...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
Do as I say!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
And?
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Quick -- hide in here...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
The English??
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
What did it tell you?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Is it long and hanging down?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Wait, wait...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
What have you done to me?
My... visions...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What signs?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
But you already confessed this morning...
Is that bad?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
I'm on the run!
Henryk's in there.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What did you pay him?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Why didn't you come to me?
Pig!
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Which mountains are those dear?
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
You'd have to organise it up here.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Yes, why not.
You have to wash them.
We can't leave the piano
What does she say?
He's given it to us.
You the owner here?
Which way are the rooms?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'll take him anyway.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
No signs of trouble?
You think he'll show?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
I'm not sure I know it.
Raise 500.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
My end was only one.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
You should always look to the back too, kid.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
You got the 400 grand yet?
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What's your next step, Nick?
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Well!
Mind if I look around?
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
Then what are you hiding?
Did he tell you where he was going?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
There. 
I don't know.
Dead?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I know -- I know --
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
But it isn't bad weather now.
You can take that out to the car.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Nothing.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Who's is it?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Well, what'd you think?
Could this be him?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's ridiculous.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Who's that man?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
That's my business.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, please, Nick.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Where's Gilbert?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
Perfectly absurd.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I've never heard about you.
Why tell me?
What's that?
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
What hit me?
Isn't that my drink?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
There's one coming.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Finished with these?
Aren't you hot in that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
But Wynant --- ?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You bet I wouldn't.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick!
Wynant's body?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
What things made you so sure?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
You his wife?
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
Who fired you?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Not much of a pass.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
What happened?
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
Take the binoculars.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
You didn't step on any mine.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You're going to be fine.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
We should head Northeast.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Wonder how the war's going?
Getting cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
You get it yet?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Epps...
How long we going to keep this up.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
It's got a bottom.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Stress category.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I'm not hungry.
You know I don't feel well.
When?
Then why did you bring it up?
Look, food!
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
THX!
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Who?  Who's leaving?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
What's going on?
I'm leaving.
How do you know?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
She's not there
Yes.
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
And you are...?
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What're you talking about?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Ex-girlfriend?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Fuck factor?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Something round, two wires ...
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Right.
You got it.
Political.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
What do ay say?
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
What's the matter?
Who are you calling, sis?
Drop it.
I want to work this.
What the hell was that?
What about the ballistics report?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Oh shit...
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
Eleven o'clock! 
And harems ... ?
Good morning, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
And as for you, waiter--
You can trust me.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Very well, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Please.
I like you, Baron.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
The fourteenth of May.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
You like that statue?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Eighteenth century.
It's disgraceful!
Yes, madame?
Then a little nap--
Crimson!
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
You look beautiful.
Lovely.
Yes, madame?
About what?
Yes, madame?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Holy shit.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Something serious has happened.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
So, you got a name by the way?
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Now it's worse.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
I'm sorry.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Anya, I think you're crazy.
It would be a nice change from you.
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Oh--a hundred times--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Good afternoon--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Aces full.
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
Nice lines--
Where have you been hiding?
Yes?
Don't rub it in.
When?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Not a chance.
Thank you, sir. 
On the drunk.
Come in! 
How's your mother feeling?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Hello, young fellow!
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Here's your fifty.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
That's him! That's the sucker!!
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
I wish I could.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
There you are, sir.
I'm all right.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
God damn son of a...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Where'd you get that horse?
Shut up, Ike.
I'm retired.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
You don't even know him.
How you feeling, Doc?
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
So what does he want?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
What is it?
That was lovely!
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Doesn't suit you.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
What's wrong?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
I hate Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
What can I get you?
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
'Least you admit it.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
What'd you do that for?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
What about all these saloons?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I'm sure they will.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Yes -
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Do you feel better now?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
That's reassuring.
Natalya?
She married a hockey player.
Bourbon. Neat.
Do I have to do everything around here?
Blood or Dutch?
This has got to be a mistake.
Down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
And when might that be?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
... And what do you call these?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I'm busy.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Not anymore, not in the city.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're always taking his side.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
Since this morning.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
When did you talk to Harry?
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Wow!  Cool!
Yeah!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Can I help pump the gas?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Which one can I open first?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
What's going on?
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hey, watch it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
I don't know!
What?
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Reach for the sky!!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
I can manage.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I already lost everything once.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I... I don't really know.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
Why does he need money?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
How long have you known?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Did you tell Dad?
You all right?
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Live with your parents?
Private?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Are you getting this on tape?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
David --
Yes.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Madrigal's alive.
What's your name?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
Oh, man --
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Where's that?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Sorry.
Come on.
I don't see why not.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
What do you want?
You're too young.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So, what's he like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
There's no need.
Thanks, Mark.
Exactly.
Director?
Who wrote it?
Yeah.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
God, you're sick.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What?
What was your price?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
No, I don't think so.
What's on the menu this evening?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Six weeks and no sex?
A walk.
Homeless people?
Qual se tu?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
He has his doubts...
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Can we have it quiet?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Where did you get this power?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Goodnight, Spock.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Spock.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
How do you know?
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
...mark two.
What is this?
We must change our course at once.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No... I didn't.
You are mad!



Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I know you better than that.
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
I want to go to his place.
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
You said it.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That was uncalled-for.
Yes?
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Flynn!!
Hey... you guys OK?
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
A User?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
What is it?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
How was school today?
Dad, how come you know the words?
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Copy that.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Now what?
I thought this look like your work.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
He's got it.
My husband is a good man.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
What did you tell him?
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Not because you were attracted to him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
My husband can't know about this.
I can do it!
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What did he give you?
I don't take those assignments.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
As much as you used to?
Oh shit.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
What does she do?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Yeeaoowww!!
Boris and Doris?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
What's going on, Harry?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
Gotten your mail yet?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
Tell me about yourself.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Burt Reynolds.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Naw naw!
Live with what?
Yeah.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
What?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot what?
The zoo.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Elliot.
No. Not yet.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Could we try it now?
That Vietnam movie?
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
Suspect's words -
He knows.
We gotta get him outta there.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Preach on, Big D.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Well?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
We're very close!  Because of you!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
July.
What year do you think it is?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
It's just a shot to calm you.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Mason???
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
What made you think that?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Nine thirty
What?  What did you say?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
One way, or round trip?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You want somethin'?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
What time is it now?
Nothing.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No!
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What was that all about?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
You've been around.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What do you do anyway?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Did you ever?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Shit!
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Where's the safe?
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
John . . .?
He was going to take the money.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!
It's . . . it's locked.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Who the hell are you?
You've got to be--
Live there?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
Now what can I do for you?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You know what I mean.
Shut up.
You think that's a lot of money?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
What are you babbling about?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You're fucked.
They're not very imaginative?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
The old lady?
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Got any cold soda?
No police.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Oh, Jesus.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
I'm a solid man.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Next time you'll do just fine.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Two-hundred dollars?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Accident.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Got any cold soda?
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Wasn't nothing.
Where you headed?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Where'd you learn to do that?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You love him?
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Grace ... Grace?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Hope is a four-letter word.
Morning, officer.
Where ya goin'?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
I axed you a question.
Proceed.
Is that the entire message?
How old is Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
...I can't remember.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I'm not sure.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's he talking about?
Just give me a minute.
He's kind of a miracle.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
I'm not scared.
Don't be scared.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
Well, go get it then.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He tell you where them others is?
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
All week?
They really got all that money, them whores?
Like I said, I...
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
Duke.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
What'd Ned say?
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Oh.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Finish him, Ned.
Better re-load it.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Shit.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
No.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Fuck you.
Say, Ned... ?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well, suppose he does?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
I don't get it.
Who ?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Come home, Dean.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
Why don't you just calm down'
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
How do you do?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
I was out of line.
I'11 be alright.
No killing?
What is it Keaton?
What is this?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
What do you mean I can't see him?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
What call?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
What did he find?
He was accused of jury tampering.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
That's not my handwriting.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
I am on the staff of...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Who are you protecting, then?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Galvin's...
Pardon?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Why don't you get some rest?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
That's right.
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
... I'm sure you do ...
... I understand ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
I just saw her.
Thank you.
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Yes.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Hello.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
What do you want to know?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Where are you going?
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
One shouldn't live alone.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
-- talking to you...
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
Do you know where you're going?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
Where are you now?
Why did you jump?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
What else?
Where?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Here with you.
Madeleine --
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, yes!
What do you mean?
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Well?... what'll you do?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Out!
Midge!
Around.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
She died.
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Can't do what?
How ya doing?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
More.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
Who? What are you talking about?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
I won't do it.
Have you thought about what I said?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Who?
She's in there!
We need padded chairs.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
Boyd...What have we done?
Regarding what?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
My what?
Okay fine.
The hell I did!
Your ideas never work out.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Why can't we do it through the mail?
The wedding cake check?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
That's absurd.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
Take care of those chairs.
Will you please call the chair people?
Hello.
What about the chairs?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
What kind of stupid question is that?
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I'm not breathing right.
Where did you get that?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No...No.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Fucking desert.
Shut up Micheal.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Enedina and Paco ...
Which couch?
Take me there.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
So, Ramona!
How in hell does it wind up?
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Are your parents alive?
Yes -- very, very big!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Why would they be going there?
You all right?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
How should I know?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
You all right?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Nice work.
Find out anything?
That's why I'm asking.
Where's John?
There you go  best seat in the house.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What if he's busy tonight?

Dartmouth
China.
How much...?
Do I know you?
What do you think would hold it off?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Who?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
"The Country Is At War." 
They got to have something that we want.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
What is it?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...

Mmm...

So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
What the hell...
Hey the door was open.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
What brings you out here...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
What the hell do you want?
Hello Bud.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
How you doing Buddy?
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
He still likes you
He did?
What's that?
Anybody want another drink?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Your books Master Loftmore
She went to a waxwork party
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
No thank you sir we're fine.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Of course you will.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Are you humoring me?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
How're you holding up?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
I'm sorry?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Oh-kay...
That's not...It's not like that.
Love.
Why are you here?
They're calling me in to work.
Wow.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Absolutely.
Telling you...
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Something was there.  You saw it.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Adamant?
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
Jody, she tried to kill him.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
It's today?
Whatcha reading?
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Tired?
Maybe we should just...
Why?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
What are you doing here?
Think I may have cracked it.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
He killed her.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
When?
What are you doing?
I never said...
Who did?
Sabotage?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
You dropped a glass.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
I never asked you to quit!
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
:Would you stop it!
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I beg your par---
My...mother...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
STOP!
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
If that were true, I would not be here.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Only you...
What is wrong...?
No!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
HARDER!
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I'm serious.  You don't -
Rowan...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Wow...
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Which do you think is her best shot...
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
This must be one of the old keys -
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
How long have you been watching me?
then why did you marry her -
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What?
Yes...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
What's wrong with you?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Is LESLIE here?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
That's good
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You'll never believe who's in there.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Never say never.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Son.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You're a peach.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Great.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
In what sense?
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Well? Surprised?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
I'm warning you.
You do like girls, don't you?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Yes?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
How quaint.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Then what?
How long?
Maybe she used another name.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
It's our job, Gloria.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
About a year ago.
No.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Ms. Toller?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Kelly.  What is it?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I'm running away.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
You, Kelly, Sam.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
But I..
Yeah, right.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All that jumping and kicking.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Jim, are you all right?
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
No record of him.
What's this?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You've... done... this... before.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
This is something.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
You are very important, Willow.
They look like acorns.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I do what I'm told.
Because it's true.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You all right?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
You!!
Because she's sick.
She's in love.
Watch it!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I don't know, Willow.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
I'm not going in there.
We gotta follow them.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
I'm getting her out of there!
Hey, careful there!
Obviously.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Your hole is healed, then?
Everything is all right, John.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
Don't let them hurt you.
What have you got?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
You have no right to keep us here.
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Oh? Anything else?
Who are they?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Enjoying your reading?
What else can you do?
Sure.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Anybody know about this?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
I'm coming.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You admit you're lying?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
What's so funny?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Get back in there.
Aunt Em!
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Yes.
Uhh -- yeah --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Our echo.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, now?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Oh --
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
We might.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh, my!
Yes -- let's run!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Does it work?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
...yes.
...free!
Did I scare you?
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
No -- No -- No -- No!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
That's right.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
-- Ruined my exit!
What happened to Len Tashka?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Nuclear.
Is there another way?
Hes sealed himself in.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
He survived?
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Shell get over it.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.
I cant stay.
Vodka martini.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
One... last... screw?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Now...where were we?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Mother of God.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter --
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Blake?  Dead?
Jon --
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
-- What is it.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're practically on us . . .
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
What new information?
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What happened?
What caused it?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
What is this place?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
What do I get out of it?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
What do you have?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Whatchu doing here?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
I don't know what you're talking about.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Yorgi and Kirill.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
What...?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What does that mean?
I wish I could go.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
What's wrong with him?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Anything else I can get you?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
The point of what?
Now that's Magneto talking.
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
Don't you knock?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
I lost him.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
And who might you be?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
And your passport?
Will you miss me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Ready, darling?
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Well... we'll see.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Did you hear that strange music??
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes.
How's it going?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
What monster?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Come on, big fellow!
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
May I see your violin?
Are you busy?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Look, Doctor!
Oh, Doctor!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Good night, Doctor.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?

Drink!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
