Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Well, there's someone I think might be 
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
What crap?
No
I hope so.
Who?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Queen Harry?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
It's just you.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre teen belly button ring for you?
So they tell me...
Thirty two.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma shit grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
He seems like he thrives on danger
Like we had a choice?  Besides  when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school wide blow out.
It's her favorite band.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Away.
Are you lost?
We're not.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Does it matter?
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
Oh, right.  Friday.
I told you
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Something like that
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
Because you're making decisions for me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Just smack her now.
Yeah.  I guess.
No   I've got a sweet payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
Well, you know  there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Your life, and that of others!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I am busy inside.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I'm not bargaining!
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
He understands.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Damn God!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Give me absolution.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesn't work.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
What about Oleg?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Give me another one, please.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
Yes, I considered it.
I'll get my clothes.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
You're a cop   you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back   I just forgot.
But Chief?  Over this??
Vodka tonic.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Nah, why should you?
Pretty.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Of course.
Something back home?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I'm not.
You're ruthless.
See you later.  Good luck.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
I'm not moody.
Keep them out of my way.
No.  Are you proposing?
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
You'll be my first.
Two weeks holiday.
Is there a problem?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
Whatever we do   we fuck her, right?
Cut!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this   no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Excuse me?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay, come on down.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO unit about to fail again.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi  dence in the mission.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
Thank you, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes, very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit   about twenty four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hammond.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Must be billy's girl.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works ...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You sure that's the reason?
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
I didn't have the time.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I'm heading out. How about you?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You're hopeless.
I guess he got the message...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hiya, kid.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Where is he?
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
First, the money.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
Napoleon... small.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
They are... with me...
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
He's on vacation.
Not without Leeloo.
What mission?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
What is it?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Uh..you're welcome.
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
...The rain falls...
Exactly.
I love you...
Been here long?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Actually only one cell survived..
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Recommendations.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know what to say
Amy...
There's nothing harder.
What can I do for you today?
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Where are the women?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
We do.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Fuck you.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
Max.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Where does he sell it?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Nope.
I try to be.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
We were married forty five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
You're joking.
I'm here.
Yes, but...
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
What?
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
What?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Oh God!  He killed them!
You're not taking my baby!
No...
Who said I...wait, what?
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
To take a picture.
Sobering...
I've got to go.
But Dad 
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
Well we gotta do something!
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Stick around, please?
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
We're all risking our lives!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Something wrong?
What????
What about time...?
We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a super scale....
As ready as we can be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
What?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Toward the Pole!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Twombley involved?
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You can't buy Wade off.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Oh.
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for  450, 500 bucks? 
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
What blood?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Look. Those kids are still trick or  treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says 
What am I  a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
His office. You mean my old office.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Huh?
How was she?
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
What about her?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Well, I never heard that one.
Wade, are you alright?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
You're jet lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Some kids were teasing you?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Lemme take a look.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
To swear you in as President.
Because it is my duty.
Dead.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Copy, Air Force One.
Thank you.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
That was war.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Over my dead body.
You'll do it?
Excuse me?
But...
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I might still have a few chips left.
That's my job.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
Accelerators down.
Sir?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ask Simon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, please be careful.
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
What can I do, Doctor Rumack?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Scraps.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A  okay up here and ready for count down.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Yes.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I can't tell.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Yes. Yes, of course.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
But if you'll just give me...
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Thank you.
No. No thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up, please?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes  it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
No, Sergeant  not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
The murder at the mini mart is not our case.  The Captain said
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step  I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know  It would threaten our entire existence here.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
The human?
Yeah, I'll bet.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Hey, look  we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
How long until it blows?
What?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Well, the corporation co financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Uh hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty seven colonists here 
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Sir?
Alive?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
On my way.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
No.. I've slept enough.
They're dead.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Look!
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine   A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine   A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
A brothel.
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Sra I'm sick! Sra I'm sick!
Em iram! Em iram!
Just say it   you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Ui vol i tub!
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, ask her!
Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
You'd think I was mad.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm   I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What?
I was at hand.
Leave him alone!
Adorable!
Hey!
Ah ha!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then   just now and then   it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well. There it is.
He's here.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no   not exactly like this. I mean today   just today, Stanzi   I remember now. She had to go   yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
No one calls you that.
Good morning, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Can I see it?
Well, we can.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Did you like it, then?
She is well. She is   well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Whom did they choose?
I'm afraid not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Do you mean that?
I'm too young to be so sick.
Yes.
I think so.
I'm not leaving you.
What for?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Here in Vienna.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Ah   you've heard that?
I poisoned his life.
Yes?
Italian?
Yes.
Incredible.
Yes, in the third act.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No, a cab will be faster.
I dream of death mostly.
Will you come with me?
There is only one bed.
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
I wasn't hallucinating.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
No.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Alex?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
So they said.
Did you see Jack?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
It's a five pointed star.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Are you going to help me up?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
Nurse!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Yes.
How shall I do it?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
It was more than that last week.
Here's twenty five thousand.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
I haven't got it.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Well, you can. You always could.
Don't you know?
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'm listening.
Yes.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred   or Gwynn
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Mine too?
What'll we do?
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
With what?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
I tell you, I saw them!
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff  necked, horse dollar.[6]
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, sir.
It couldn't have been earlier?
Then where were you?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
What?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Hey!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
You're not scared, are you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Sorry.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I got us through the War all right.
Pass me some whisky.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
I'd appreciate that.
I think he's already feeling better.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You can shut up now.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob's upset.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
Boys?
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
What?
I figured.
I'm not hanged yet.
Thanks.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
They had to be dealt with!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Yes sir.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Sir?
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
I can't believe this.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
What do you want, Courtney?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Well, it's not a turn on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Do...what.
Evelyn?
I don't want to talk about it.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We never really shared one.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Yes, naturally.
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
It's just not.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
When?
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Yes, Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Make someone happy have you ever wanted to?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
No. Flattering, but no.
That's...that's too bad.
What?
No.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself 
No. I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle 
It's no problem
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
No, I guess it's okay.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
I hope I'm not being cross examined here.
No. Not really.
Hang...out?
No, he just hung out there.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Well, to each his own. So lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
And?
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Al.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Yes, Owen?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
'Gonna wait outside.
"Make" him?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards 
...Whaddo I do?
...Different?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
You can't pre empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What'd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your dish?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
We tried!
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
It needs a more object oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
What're you implying.
I'm sure.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
'Start up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary, don't worry, we 
Let's go.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break in?
Keep looking.
Let's get him in here.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
Where we going?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Then and now.  But not right now.
She saved my life.
Hmm?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like 
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You mean  break in?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to 
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Let's try #2.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Uh. Not exactly.
What?!
What d'you mean?
I could get it out of him.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Good luck, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
What?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes, Basil?
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind expanding drugs in a consequence free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel  see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Sure.
I'm sure.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
Indeed.
Shut up.
Likewise.
That's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Yes.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Dr. Evil?
They're mutated sea bass.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I don't want to.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Seriously?
There are limits?
... bottle ...
Black...
... preserve...
... love ...
Promised? Who promised?
Sir August...?  What now?
Mr. John Steed, please.
We have met ...
This isn't a game.
Hmmm ...
Let me guess  'Father'?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Too many cooks 
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
So what was all this  some sort of test?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Do you really think so?
An eccentric recluse?
June, July ... August?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Did he say who?
Very good, Steed ...
Is there anything that isn't?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Winning isn't everything.
After you  Mrs. Peel ...
... Or grown ups, who still like to be children.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
I'm no spy  where do I fit in?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Decontamination  ?
I see.
Peter's brother?  But 
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Anyone particular in mind?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty  and so am I.
I feel sure of it.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Ugh ...
Check out the other guy's buns.
Women!
Bond... James Bond.
Five thousand dollars.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
So does Debbie.
Yes I did.
Yes, sir, I am.
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm going now, Cole.
It looks awful.
What's the matter?
Good...
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Your mother's not dead.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yes...
Ilene, Rick promised...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
I think I screwed that one once.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Let's have a toast.
What's going on?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Screw that.
You're a pimp?
Milt?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
What do you mean, it changes?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Olivier's in that, right?
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Got me.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I don't know.
Be gentle.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It works.
Millions, Stephen  And sexual favors.
Hey! You don't know me 
Brian    See ya tonight.
This?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Everybody did.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
 What are you doing here?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North Side jag off with a mouth.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
 You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
 I work for the city.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Hey, do I know you?
Who's doing this?
What?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
What are you listening to?
No it couldn't.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured "
What reason?
Yeah? Airtight?
Yeah.
No.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
What the hell are we waiting for?
I was ahead of my time.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
Cute.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
I'll be there.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Fixing my roof.
He's going to be a fireman.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't  I just couldn't...
What's wrong?
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
He works for me.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be all and end all?
Who?
Yes.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I 
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and 
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
B L A K it is.
YEAH!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
You might be right.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Look at my lips.
Damn skippy.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Did we get our bill yet?
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We're starving.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
No costume.  No blackface.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I'm sorry I'm late.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get together except you?
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Go on.  Good so far.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Exactly!
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
We think so.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
I didn't mean that, in life.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
You getting cold feet?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
The pleasure is mine.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub human.
I don't want to hear it.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
I feel fine.
It looks delicious.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
What's a Negro.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
The best defense is offense.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non threatening African  American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan   The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
You tellin' the truth.
The one with da big...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...to big.  The in between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
How be dat?
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
A song a comin' I feel.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Just a little something' somethin'.
No, before my time.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Y'know what?
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Why don't you answer?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I never was more in earnest.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
How do you do, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well  and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me  do you mind that?
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half a dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your honor must lower his voice.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certain?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then you must get it.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes!
What is to be done?
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Yes, of course.
I see.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
And he doesn't care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
What do we do?
We found him like this...
Tell me about them.
I'm serious 
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
And the bodies?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West 
Why?
We just want to check your pack 
Yeah...
Oh, come on 
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it 
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
You said you wanted to know what happened  I'm telling you the truth.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
My heart weeps.
No. I said Dunbar.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts  His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
The Senator...
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous 
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You knew Sergeant West?
That is the most unprofessional 
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Got it.
I don't think that has anything to do with 
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Watch me.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal 
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here 
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
What?
What Kendall said  "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission 
You couldn't have known 
That's gonna stay my secret.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Isn't this how your story goes?
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Poor fucker my ass...
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
You can't threaten me 
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret 
 failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself 
Yeah.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes!
I don't expect to.
Was she nekkid?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
Stop.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
What's your name, Giant?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Beats me.
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
What did he say?
I will.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
What?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
It would kill you, huh?
The river?
How what happens?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
'Fraid so.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
Did you?
They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.
We rented a car.
He's up with your father.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Yes?
Yes. Thank you.
Do you want to stop?
Yeah.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Good. 
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard  He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
You're asking for my documents?
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Oh nothing.
No. It is too judgmental.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Good night.
What? What does he want?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
You don't understand anything.
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
You don't want to talk about it.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes neither.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You don't have to say anything
Please, there's no... Oh.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Thank Christ for that.
No.
No. I think I better just go.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Just wanted to see.
Oh! Gave me a start.
You didn't have to do this.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
That'd be nice.
At church?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I need ya help again.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Sure.
You been home yet?
You need a ride?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Don't need none.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Whose doin' is that?
Hm mm... Hm mm...
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Maybe I won't.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Now, hold up.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Or what?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I do.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store bought junk. That's what she said.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Rae don't do this now...
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Yeah, I do.
The hell you call me?
Let go...
Charlie...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Where is the subway station, please.
Number five with a bullet.
Hey, when in Rome 
What does Charlie mean?
Where would you look for the mafia?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why weren't you at the platform?
Yeah...
I can see that.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
San is an honorable title.
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Kampai.
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I don't remember you saying no.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Then take it from him.
It is not allowed.
Do you know what this is?
If anything happens to her while I'm here 
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Oh?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last  as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car  built to win, not to last.
Of course not.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro  field.
We're using Esper  a 231  that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Yeah.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self perpetuating thought, para physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
And what in your estimation works?
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
I'm doing okay.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus sixes.
Meaning?
Yeah?
Huh huh.
Nope.
Of course.
What night?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Me and my dad.
Like?
What's a long time?
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering  if they're programmed for it.
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Five, maybe six.
Don't move.
A tortoise.  What's that?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
What's that?
What?!
No, you get out of here.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Heck, no!  What?!
What is it?!
Perry?
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
They like Dr. Pepper.
My Mom and Dad.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Okay.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Why?!
Sure.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
The engine is still running.
Sure.
That's boring!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something
Do I look crazy?
Not that one!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
But, Eve, I would
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
No.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
My mother's like that.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Why?
Shit is a French word?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
My father is a genius.
Thirty five.
Up there!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll go up.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
No.
All our friends...
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Hi.
You bet.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
We do?
Excuse me.
do as I say!
I thought ten years.
What are you doing here?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, that's blunt!
No.
He's from Alaska.
Eve?!
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Yes, you do!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Have him committed.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I, I don't know.
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
That's good.
I'm doing it.
Frank would open you.
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Who, Dorothy?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What?
Be right down.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Where are they?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well  dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What is it?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead!
No Jeffrey!!
Okay.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
What?
Where's your gun?
Let's do him right here.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty  five year old delivery boy?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We... met them last night.
How many?
Shut it. It's Ma.
Yeah. It's been twenty seven years.
...so that which is good may flourish
For what?
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Yes, we are.
Yes.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
A fuckin' men!
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
What?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Twist of lemon!
Shit! Shit!
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Hey, Murph.
So?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia  fuckin bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Yes.
Open it!
Fuck you Vincenzo.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
He says. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Nothing. Go ahead.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Bob?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Hi.
What. What's the matter?
No kidding.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
This was in fourth grade.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
I don't think we can do that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just 
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred 
I know.
Get out of the way.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was all right.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
I don't think so.
Oh, I'd say about 
Behind Bob's house.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
So do I.
Me?
Yeah.
See you, Bob.
He looked too shaken up.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
No, I don't mind.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Jesus Christ! No.
Sure.
No.
Who's got the car keys?
Temporarily.
Is that Buckethead?
True.
I don't know about that.
Not even for emergencies?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
I warned you, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
God DAMMIT.
Don't count it.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I told you they were there.
It's registered in my mother's name.
See you in a little while.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Let's go.
I didn't have any choice.
I know it, man. Hang on.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Will it track back to us?
And the Landy woman?
Never heard of it.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...this is Conklin's computer.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Thanks.
What?
Then what?
You're a liar.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Sorry. Old habits.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook 
 it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
The Telegraph office.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Back there  at the corner  Hyundai  silver 
 where?  
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
Tell me later.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
What do you mean?
You never worked Berlin...
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
 the hotel  how far? 
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
 no!  not me!  no other people! 
That's where we came out.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You mean, did I want a date?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Are we hacking or asking?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
It was in Latin, sir.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
I have ordered conscriptions...
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Wallace's followers.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
No. One of us is enough.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
A common thief.
We don't split up!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
How do you know this?
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight  and fight he did.
It's battle I want, not talk.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
How soon?...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
What? What could he do?
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
No, protecting her.
Photos?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
You'll see.
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Different? How?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step sister.
Know what?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
...yes.
Been there, done that.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
 Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, yes.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you, but I hardly think 
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
 Tonight he forgot.
Er, my check, please.
It's not for sale at any price.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Good day.
And the other alternative?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Looking for a job.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
You can believe that if you want to.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
No.
 You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
 Yes?
I love you very much, my dear.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Are you quite finished with us?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Good day.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But everybody's having such a good time.
Huh!
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
 Thanks. I will.
That was some going over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
What friend?
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
You think of everything, don't you?
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Our expenses?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I never make plans that far ahead.
 Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
I like it fine here.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Then don't have a drink.
No, I don't.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Worse than Warsaw.
Take it.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Nothing out there but ocean.
No.
Okay.  Sure.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of 
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Yeah.
Let's eat.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and  but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but 
We're on.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh  baked bread, apple pie...
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already *Captain* Worthington!
Good night, Daddy.
Two.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sandthere won't be any sharp edges.
It will be okay.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
No, don'tthat's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, tooyou know I did.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I know what you've been doing.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Cirrhosisit's a disease of the liver.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
A B 24 Liberator.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yes, for both.
In other words, scurvy.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely uselessI expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
It's your heartyou ought to take it with you.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourselfyou're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Tell him what you want, Muddy*you* is the crew boss today.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch 22
The standard ten.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
And what about Big Al?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
I'd like this cashed, please.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Y y you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick  pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Here's my deal  Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Then show me how.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
There are three people I trust  him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about what?
You sure we're clear?
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
And we got rid of the red head.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Eee Oott Auught!
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
A Fed? Is he close?
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
What do you get out of it?
To who?
All men are cheats.
What's the Blue Book price?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
You want me drunk?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You've got such beautiful hands.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Marion, stop this.
Marion. It's a book.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
You were talking in your sleep.
Then what?
Don't let yourself down.
Absolutely not.
I don't gamble.
That's fine.
You choose.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
Wait a minute...
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Who did it? Tell me!
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Over the river.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
Some other time.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
That bitch? No.
I'll tell you later.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Has he?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
Five.
Five.
I said good call.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
Key? Key? What is the key?
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
All right, then...
Energy shielding positive function.
No.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
But how do you know you exist?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Yes, well...
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
I need a computer reading on a fail  safe mark.
Any planets?
What?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Out where?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling  the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Yeah?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
No?
I'm on a break.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Where?
Don't look down.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I ain't mad at you...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
They took my daughter.
Like I said This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hello...
I don't want to move away.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
When?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Too early to tell.
Something.
You need to get out more.
How well do you remember the lab?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Somebody's got to.
I don't know what to say.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two oh two Sansomme.
Oh?
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You're also a fool.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
I understand.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar  codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
But, of course, there's nothing self  serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
What if he's on the level?
But there's another side
I'm the victim here.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
You don't.
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Shut up...
I was on call. 
He's sick.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Theo's dead.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
More than anything in the world.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Thanks.
Right, slow...
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Uhh... nothing.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Simple icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah, you did!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light 
So... that's it?
Not until like... eighth grade.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Sure.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Until it withers away.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Why?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Are you okay?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Where is she?
But you're OK?
It's safe here.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Do you get to meet Ed?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
He said to follow him.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
What else makes you feel regret?
If God exists?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
How did you know 
It is a big deal.
I guess they made him do it.
But now you can't go.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
No more fuckin' for her.
She's right over there.
I  I'm quittin' the pageant.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything  relationships, dreams  your tummy, ass and thighs  all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant  the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Yeah, you betcha...
Right by the airport  Oh, Amber...
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama  look out!
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
No, wait. It  it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Bitch!
Here, have some.
Yes...
Yah sure, fine... fine.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, naw. Hi.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Mm hm.
"U.S.A. is A okay."
"Can I? I'm Amer I Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yah  Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
A.k.a. Minneapolis  St. Paul.
Nothin' too showy!
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
We need more bars!
Harold!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
What, you deaf? I say shut up  shut up  SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
"My dear"...
I no gotta new rosis.  My uncle he's  a got a flower shop  he's a gotta new rosis.
All right  
Well, maybe he's still the vice  president.  Now if I were to offer you 
Well, if you wanna work in the post  office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you  Secretary of War.
What do I get?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers 
That's all right.  We let you have twenty five thousand men  and we both start even.
Sure.
Fine   keep on yelling   Do everything you can to disturb Firefly   Now what about your cousin?
All right  I'll go out and find one.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week  
You swine!
Yes.
I don't remember.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Why  why  of course.
Don't bother me   I'm thinking  What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms 
Well no  not exactly  but 
I didn't come here to be insulted.
This is terrible!
My dear niece  I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
No, I think a whiskey.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
I intend to.
Right... Right.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes.
Good morning.
Yes.
...I learned a long time ago.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
John Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
How is your tea, John?
Of course.
Your mother?
Good morning.
Yes, John.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Yes. John wants it.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
"The fifth one this week"!
I'll bring it back.
Goodbye, Aud...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
The sun is up beyond the clouds  where it always is.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Yes?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Don't talk nonsense.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
About raping me?
You DON'T like it, do you?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I don't know! I just did!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
That's my boy!
Row! Row! Row!
ROW!
What "magic"?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
But you're the Gods!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What is it?
What if we could find Bi Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Over the Edge of the World.
Bye... sorry...
Do what?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea sick?
That's it!
Hang on...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What have you got there?
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Yes, Mum.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Say hi to Naomi.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I told you that later.
Why?
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I'm Joel.
I'm not nuts.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so 
Very much.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to 
Yes.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
I want to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
No. Thanks.
No.
What do you mean?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
You had the whole human race pegged.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah, like that.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I think she's great.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
Oh, um...
Hey, Joel 
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we 
I just walked in.
I'm like a joke to them.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that  How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I hope you get your work done.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh! Great. That's great!
We'll speak soon.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Hi.
Sorry. I just 
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Yes?
Is that Nietzsche?
It's no big deal.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
It's a quote book.
Patrick, we're in the middle of 
Clockworks.
The Clock People?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I'm staying with the Countess.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
Tired...
A born freak can only go uphill.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women  divorcees and widows, mainly  can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond  Siwash Lake, it's called  twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens  I mean, huge mothers  and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance  leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual  yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout  oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Justin?
Coop, where are you...
What about the accumulator...?
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Hear what?
Oh God...
A power drain 
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
The dark inside me.
How do you know all this?
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio scan?
Skipper...
Do it.
Justin.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Negative.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
If it worked, yes.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Starck... Cooper...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Love to.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Captain, we got a problem.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Let's go.
I just finished drying...
What's causing the readings?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
There was a another surge in the bio  readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
What's going on in there, Starck?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Five seconds.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Blow it up?
Yes.
He's been past Mars?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Not according to the computer.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
She's not ugly.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm alright. Please.
I like the sound of that.
Is it safe?
Oh, he did.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in 
Should?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect 
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Ben, are you there?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova 
Blockhead started it!
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself 
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Never better.
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
What? What do you mean you 
We need to get past them.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
You need a doctor.
Hilarious.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass produced this by now.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
First door on your left!
Don't strain yourself.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
See you later.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
They were left over from the last shift.
What a guy.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
Let's continue.
I didn't see you this morning.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B 8. Give me a break.
What do you mean  wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Damone. It's Mark.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Fascinating.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Really?
He was hot, wasn't he?
No way! He just called him a dick.
It was okay.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Not since November.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Yeah, like maybe never.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Yes.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
I know, everyone says that.
No problem.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes  especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead  I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross section of mean tempered rule crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Not where we operate.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Hell, no!
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You whore!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why what?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
How about a check?
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty  five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.
Me?
It's gone too far.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
We can't risk letting them in.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
Where's that?
Come on, come on.
And the rest of 'em?
Easy.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Buddy, I'm a full blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
No. You?
The door... on three.
Why don't you go check it out?
My truck.
What's in the back?
Well...
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
But 
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
What?
Covered.
Whoa!
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Am I too heavy for you?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
And the last one is the...
That's fine.
All right.
I think 
Thank you 
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm not!
Thank you.
Huh.
In my eyes, officer.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here 
Showdown.
Dick, we need some time apart 
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
No. Never.
Thanks, Dad.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard earned talent.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Fifteen.
I wouldn't miss it.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Yeah, well 
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non gentleman's non  gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Forget it.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
The hell you will, Harry York.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Frances...
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
No. To thoroughbreds.
What's that?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Oh Harry...
Yeah. I don't know.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
How did I look?
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Fine!
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy 
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Your big speech?
You got it.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Go on...
I'll be back.
Mama...?
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
But what  
Don't I know you?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
It ain't for lack of trying.
I see.
Stay calm, please.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Yeah?
Then why weep for him?
Better that way... for me.
Worse.
Yes. Very close
You speak.
How did you find me?
I see it before me.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's not for you.
So have I
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Fine.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Quite a send off, isn't it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Not as weak as I.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Oh God.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Thank you, Henry.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
The strain was evident.
Are you a physician?
Would be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
You know of it?
Bill  Bill  Bill is out there...
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Thanks, Alice.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Wet. I don't know.
Oh, you...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
A short somewhere.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Whatever you make yourself.
That was the telephone.
Whassamatta?
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
That's thirty percent.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
What's this about, money?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Auto wreck.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4 H club.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Yep.
Scott?
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
You asked me if I would 
Yes.
Anytime.
Later.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Knock yourself out.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
No.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
He needs our help!
Who's "we"?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses 
Your prerogative, Senator.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm not sure what 
Smoke her.
Fuck me.
Did you hear?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military  but for your own confirmation as well.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know  that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war  and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
I'm sure it is.
Fuck.  Basher Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank  just something until the A team shows.  Over.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I oughtta report you.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only 
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way  his world  had come and gone.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Just like you would be.
I'm only trying to warn you in case 
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
You don't crap out of Spec Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Yeah.  Me too.
And how do you know that?
Thanks, Wick.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
That's a good story.
Sure, sure.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
For pulling a 210 pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Should I be afraid?
I think you're the liar.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options  move out or ring out. End of file.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
What's our go to shit plan, O'Neil?
Great. See ya then.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Most people don't.
I got pretty close.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Speak of the devil.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Five bucks.
It's your choice.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
I don't think so.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
They are with me!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Thanks.
Why are you telling this to me?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Makes us look more American.
It's okay. I know her.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Is that the bathroom?
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
You go first! There's no time!
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets 
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You have a better plan, Alex?
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
The ships are gaining...
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
No I didn't.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
We're doing episode 31?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
One minute   I'm    Hey, I'm dressing.'
Only answers to me.
Let me think. I need time to think.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Right.
Because it was on the show!
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
You have ten seconds.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Home.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Well... Sort of...
And determination.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's as far as it goes!
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal...
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Congress is talking  openly  about replacing you with Lee.
We're so damned important!  Look at us  Nathanael, you were a horse  shoer, Benedict, before this?
That can't be.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
That you would have known you can trust me.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
To learn to shoot cannon?
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
I'm not sure.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
A ground swell Christian movement, George, you see?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Uh... none just now, but...
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
I think I heard that.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We're leaving them?
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
Then, maybe I do see what you're after  perhaps... you get to chose again...
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
I think I will disappoint you.
I see...
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
No. What's this?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Harry, let me answer that.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
What about her?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Gimme an hour.
In the can. That the money?
I can't do it.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Okay. So who are you?
Never heard of him.
Look at me, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm in the movie business.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Fuckin' basketball game.
They always paid.
Who's the star?
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
His shrink's trainer.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
I found him.
Who?
Ask your man here.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
I know what a vig is.
...That's what we finally decided.
I married Martin. That was a full  time job.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Don't go out of your way.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
I'm thinking about producing.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry  
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
That's where you got the idea?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Morning, skipper.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Gimme a break.
Why not?
Sounds reasonable.
I gotta pull the blades and re seat everything in a new rotor  .
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
It looks like it.
What is it?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
You smashed it!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Because of the gold.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
The guy. He just came this way.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
But, who  ?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
Epps, over.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north west.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
And look what happened.
A what?
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Fine with me.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You pump it out and re seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Fifteen, at the most.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
How should I know?
Who?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
But I can't 
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
No.
Can I come in?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I thought Chipmunk face was never going to shut up.
What?
Why?
How perfect.
Just look at them!
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
It's still twenty five minutes early.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
We should follow him home.
Gross!
Forget it, I can't explain it...
What, is she black now?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Let's go hassle Josh.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Everybody's too stupid!
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Where?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I told you   my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
What are you talking about? Who?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh grade fantasy!
Well, we won't keep you.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
That's okay...
Seymour does.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I know it's over, asshole, I 
That tape sucked, by the way!
Yes.
You're late, asshole.
Hey, where are you going?
What?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Sure, I guess.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Watch my stuff.
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you  it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, right...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Shh!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud   it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else   give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking  why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
That's the spirit!
Oh yeah?
Who knows?
How can you be so sure?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Can you at least let me in?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
But, I...
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out  this is a totally fucked up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Right, exactly!
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
He'll replace you, too  that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
But I have in India  every country presents problems.
Don't they, though?
Yes he is.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already  and if they come in, word will get out  and what happens to your knighthood then?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
 please  you needn't be so graphic 
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
What if there are complications? 
The females are bigger  only animal here like that  have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Have you got that in writing? 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
We know three things about man eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old  they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone  they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
You mean nobody died?
Nonsense  Samuel would have done something. 
No, but you do    see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Has it ever done that before?
Don't they have to be?...
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
Thank you, Samuel.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Four should do it.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you  you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
We don't have a relationship.
Does he ever mention me?
Okay, let's take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Now you're talking.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
Yes, the scourge 
 the sorrow 
Yes.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that 
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Why don't we try the Giga meter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
And we're the ...
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just  someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter 
I'll get one more reading.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
No, I just thought 
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and  I don't know  I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
I am Zuul.
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
Well, let's check it out.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide  we can read after we eat.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you  in the bedroom.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What calls?
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA?  What's he want?
You could say that.
A square?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
I'm always serious.
She's telling the truth  or at least she thinks she is.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl   no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
She said he was "the Destructor."
And look at this, Peter  Cold riveted girders with selenium cores.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free roaming, vaporous, full torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
What do we do now?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
And the seas would boil ...
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I'm sure, I don't know.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly  you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Gladly Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now!
I'll nose around...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You don't know how wrong you are.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full blown invasion of Germany.
Yours will do!
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
So I understand.
They fear me.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Well, we can try...
I can't let you do that.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Greeks?
I can see that...
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
No!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Chain him.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter  the best fighter I have ever seen!
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you  anything!
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Yes.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine 
No, I couldn't.
Wait a minute.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Of course there is. Look  The Veranda Room  right there.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Get out of here.
At the Zoo.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street  and I've been getting to some classes 
Did you say rape her?
Elaine  right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
My belt.
I don't know.
No.
I don't know.
Yes.
I'll think about it.
Benjamin  I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right  I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
No, Benjamin.
Shhhh.
What?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother  Reverend Smith  and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in  from  Portland  and I've forgotten what church  you see?
Mr. McQuire.
Yes, sir.
Not exactly.
I am going to call the police now.
What?
Look  I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you mean?
What?
Like what?
So?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin  I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd 
I've got to go.
Of course.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's  it's pretty hard to be suave when you're 
What?
I haven't. No.
Why don't I get it? Well  I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Benjamin.
Benjamin.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Are you kidding?
If you want.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Well what do you want to talk about?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
There!
I walk out.
What?
Thank you.
See if you can guess.
Art.
Kind of.
How do you think.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Why not?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
But if it's sickening for you 
Benjamin  I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed 
Very good, sir.
When I go off?
Goodnight.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Oh, Ben  this is so  exciting 
About an hour ago.
About what?
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Ben  how old are you now?
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben 
You'll never be young again.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
Yes, sir.
Oh yes.
No, it's not 
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Yes, I can.
I'd like to discuss this.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
Every glass high to life  the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief  brief life  and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know  I've only lived since last night  but that little while seems longer than all the time before  all the  
The pearls are in her room.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
Not with strangers.
Dictation.  You know...
No  why?  should I?
Very little.
Where downstairs?
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I fell in love last night  the real thing.
I thought that, too  but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
For tonight. 
What do you want here?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
That is not so  you don't want to be alone. 
No  You don't want to be alone at all  You were in despair before  If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone  You mustn't cry  you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you  tell me.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear  
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock  I shall die on the gallows.
I know.
I wanted money desperately  Can you understand?  That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened  I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you  I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you  Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and  and now.
Yes  If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Oh  yes but  later.
Never mind  I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Don't.
Not at all, sir. 
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Yes, quite.
A little strange, Baron.
No, Kringelein, not tired,  just   Well  well 
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
No  not at all.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron  stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Certainly  always when Grusinskaya dances.
I thought she was splendid!
That is Doctor Otternschlag  You know him?
Mr. Preysing  one sixty four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man  I was at the clinic the whole night  there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
What?  Who?  Whom?
Nobody, Doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk  feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see  made in England, that's silk, too  fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman  no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Everything?
I'll take the bank  All right, gentlemen.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar  it's expensive but that makes no difference  I see the Baroness is laughing.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
She's beautiful  isn't she?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
You don't understand that do you?
What?
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
That'll be all  be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Well?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Why not?
Very simple  I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing  English, isn't it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All you have to do is phone for it.
And I said we didn't.
Mop rags  mop rags  we're interested in something quite different!
You've decided against the merger?
Why talk  it's over  it's over  it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester,  Manchester  Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Next week.
Foggy  frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
It will pass  it will pass  come.
Oh, Suzette  Suzette  Sshh  quiet.
Goodnight, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full  Is it really full?
Why not?
You haven't time.
No  no  wait  the man was a burglar  he was going to steal my money.
I can answer for this, it was self  defense  I can answer for this  but that girl  the scandal  my wife  my daughters, you know them?
I won't wait  I can't wait  I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
No, I won't wait  I can't  Every day is precious  every hour  Every minute.
The troupe, the scenery, everything  all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
No news yet?
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch  and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter  
Well  gentlemen.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed up all the time. Why?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I like you, too.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Goody!
So here we are!
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
But they must be! They cut glass!
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs 
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
You don't have the stomach for it.
I pay my debts.
I've really got to 
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
As though you do what I say.
This way's perfect.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You must have some money.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Not very good!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Are you sure?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You already went back to work.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
And when he got serious?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
What?
No! Because I 
For Christ's sake, why not?
Yes?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
You sure?
Nothing's missing?
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
John...
I came to see you.
Yeah.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Who?!
What?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were 
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
The voice man!  He's here!
But I've seen him!
You can't expect us to stay here 
Danny!!!
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Danny, go downstairs  Now!
Him.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It's a rune ... Thorn.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction  to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Kara, no!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Only me    and Dr. Wynn.
Didn't recognize you.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Tell them yourself!
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
Really?
Sorry.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
If what?
What?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're hollow, like a woman.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
Tell me that.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Sir?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Penelope!
Damn.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Nothing.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsboka gazelle.
Raw hamburger, pleaseand a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
DaughterI love you very much.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
Give us time.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
A telegrama phone call might have helped.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
What a honeymoon.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas nowand solid information.  I know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you.
The whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots.
Yes.
No you're not!
If he wants to go.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes backfor anything.
Hope.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Hello, Mother.
Oh dear.
She still has just the one child the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I came back.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Are you've seen it work cures?
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Now who's being cruel?
Yeswelluhthat's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
And terror, if you don't mind.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave meI had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Oh Godyou're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
Jesus.
WellI walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Yeahcripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You knowmaybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
HoneyAlcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've gotand Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ja?
I don't care what she wears.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. WoodlyI hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Stay home tonight!
If you have to go out with some guycan't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly can't you do better than those two freaks?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
It's beautiful.
No.
That man is your father.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He is my father.
Something happens to my confidence.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Yeah.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neckand someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
You're saying no.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
What?
It is?
Why would you do that?
We've got to rescue him.
Ohlook at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, eitheryammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Overpowering?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Yeah.
Three hundred?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
She's dead.
At least I'm a growing person.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
'Sucking off.'
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
You really believe all that?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Why can't I meet him now?
On your own land?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Well, what do they know?
So then, Mr. Mast...
...What do you have to offer?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Get out.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health  and yours. Like I am.
It's just a name.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
What?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Let's go.
What?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You never heard of that?
You're taking a big chance.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Harold Chasen.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Eh, no.
Oh.
It's very interesting.
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
Yes. Very much.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were alive, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Is he all right?
No more revolts.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Well     they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
It's so blue.
No. I feel more like   yodeling.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Yes. They're old friends.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Well, not dying, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
I don't care what people say.
Can't complain.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Does that worry you?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
I don't know.
I go to funerals.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
War is not all black.
To pit your own life against another.
Well, I don't...
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
And what about you?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Yeah.
Story of my life.
You mean, outside... with her.
Red, I found something 
I dunno, maybe five seconds  ow!
Oh  you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other 
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
From where??!!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough 
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
You're doing fine.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Not so fast. He barely knows him 
I can live with that.
No. Don't 
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Yes?
Not hungry.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but 
I like that...
Coffee's warming me up.
You want to know  Now  ? Here? Red, white, whatever  Guys are all the same.
What?
 Section fifty one. Step back.
What's the problem?
Hi.
We're leaving.
It's just a puzzle box.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
Stay the fuck away from me.
I have to speak to my father.
Oh Christ.
Kirsty?
Poor baby.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Forget him.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me 
What do you want me to do.
Good.
Who?
What?
Hell...
I said no.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I have to see my father.
The best part of ten years.
You mean we're moving in?
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
Why not?
I cut myself.
Shit.
So damn stupid.
I'll be scarred for life.
Can I get you anything?
I've seen worse.
Fine.
Don't go upstairs.
I... suppose so, yes.
Do you care ?
That's right.
No.
I prefer the floor.
What's wrong?
Steve.
I said: I found a room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture 
I've forgotten.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Sure.
What's the problem?
If there's a train.
Oh, I don't know. Up tight. Frigid.
Oh no.
I beg your pardon?
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion  is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter  day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Oh, so what's the point then?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record  which we didn't even have  and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What do you mean, "what?"
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
No.  We need the gig.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
I have all of the others.
Nothing.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
We work there!
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business  crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are  you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
Liz, hold on a second   What?
 FUCK OFF!
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Fine.  One.
Just ask it!
Will you please just go?
Have you slept with him yet?
I don't have your number.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny  rabbit looking earth shoe wearing "Doctor Who" watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
It was kind of funny.
That bad, eh?
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
Mmnn.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them 
Not really.
I mean it.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
It's a crematorium.
What difference does it make?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Well call her mother.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Sixty.
Nice.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Yeah.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
The boy _died_?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
That bothers you?
You are being foolish.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Follow me.
At least.
A factor of age.
I see.
That would be difficult to explain.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in '31?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
The inheritance.
I'm just curious.
Now there's a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Never take up poker, Detective.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
What are you doing man?
 In nomine sanctus esperitu 
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I was nearly killed.
Yes.  Always.
What?
This is madness!
No!
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Far away.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish yours?
You seem to understand a great deal.
If you wish to play games, Major.
I had no choice.
Figure she's with him?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
How many came?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Kahn?
Sit.
Head still secure to the neck.
What are you doing here?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I've had a few more concerns.
You're wrong.
Are you here?
Should I care?
Yes.
No.
That's none of your business.
I presume it's a sword.
Your murder weapon?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Hildy!
What's the idea of locking this?
Hello, Bensinger.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here  I'm in a phone booth.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
No, I was going to give it to her  but she left hurriedly.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Well, er  it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No  she didn't.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me   after I'm gone.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
No, you don't!
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing  making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife  even if she's no longer your wife.
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time 
What?!!
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced  I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll faced!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
What for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
So  Sweeney gets twins  and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart 
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Hold on a minute.
Yes. Where is he?
Whoa  wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll 
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post  exclusive!
Is he coming back here?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Nobody?  Morningside three one two four.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you 
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh h...  I'm going out and find her!
Yeah   but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But  I guess I can't, Walter.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double crossing  everything on the level!
You  you!!
You grey haired old Judas!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You got plenty of money?
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I think it is.
You said it!
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Yes, sir.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
I'll have it in a minute.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital 
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
I thought so, too.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother!
That man there!
Very simple, Earl.
What's that? Only  you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
They're not human!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Ssh!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Who do you think!
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
I'll explain it tomorrow!
You're insane!
A very fine looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor 
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well   we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
She and Mollie were talking.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Very well, Grandpa.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
No, she didn't.
Bugger off.
Won't they have maps?
Would.
Ask her yourself.
We thought it was poison.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
...and six...
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air raid?
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
What's that?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Half the time he's bluffing.
The ideas you get in your head.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty eight.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Look after yourself, Grace.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Huh... what cone?
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Baby! Stop!
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
OK.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
A dead one.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
You know... a couple of queers.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Great story Goober, how much?
Holy crap, thanks!
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Lock the fucking doors.
Where ya headed?
There's a dog in the road.
Quiet.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
He should be back in a couple hours.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Tickets for what?
That seems likely.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Sleeping.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Tell me about it.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I don't doubt that.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
You said it, not me.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What! God damn, how many?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Wait, I want to say good bye.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Right.
That's it?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider man is. Get to your point.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative  specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And think about what you've done.
Like father, like son.
Woof.
French?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Unnhh.
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Three foot one.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Shut up, you.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Paper or cloth?
I'm not sure.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
A deer?
I think he's feral.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nothing. Be right out.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh huh. Exactly.
Good. Making progress.
That's great.
I guess.
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Ooka.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Even better.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
here, here.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
That's the way it's done.
Deal the cards.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Yeah? Why?
You being cute?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Whaddya been so far?
Why?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
That's a  that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
How're the hands?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
In Louisville it was seventy five per cent.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
You well heeled, partner?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
I don't want it.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Get with what?
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
How much?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Ten dollars.
You're a pretty good player.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Since four.
Fine, thanks.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Come here.
Thanks.
You want to go with me?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's it so hot in here for?
Why did he tell you?
Is he a winner?
Yes, I'm glad.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Come here. Come on, now.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
Well, what's the matter?
California. Oakland.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You lived like this once.
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
You hunt us like animals  do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills 
Yes.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
That's fine.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in 
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Sure ... fine.
I'll take you to school.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes  but ...
May I ask why?
No.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
But it's not, Jimmy.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Maybe  it landed in the bushes.
Hide the car.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there  you still haven't seen the best part.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
All right.  I'll be right back.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
Connie, don't hang up.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
David, don't...
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Dad...
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
He wasn't the President then.
What'd I say?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
She should be shortly.
Yes, Sir.
And our troops here?
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I'm a dancer.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
Dad was onto something here!
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Arghhh! Oh!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
We're through!
I usually don't.
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad  by tomorrow it will have faded.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
So it did.
Then wait  count to twenty.
Don't worry  I'm fine.
Good point.
He was actually there? You saw him?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Yeah?
...the solution presents itself.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
What about Marcus?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
I know, Dad!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
"J".
I can get it  I can almost reach it, Dad.
After you, Junior.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Compensation for my brother in law's car. Indy, your father and Brody 
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Miss Scott panicked?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Finally!
No  you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been 
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Why?
Behind you!
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by 
Siam.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
What?!
THE WHAT?!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" 
Don't catch cold.
That's it  the release lever  look inside!
Quiet!
Yes, they believe you.
Not quite.
What for?
Willie, come on!
Al ???!!!
Al.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
What is your name?
I just got here.
Where are we?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
I just went there for a job.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
With a man in my head...
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
I can't remember..
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'm at the airport.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Use my credit cards.
Who cares?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What was?
Try another language.
What can I do? You're on your own.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Rene...
That place. By the window.
Are you serious?
I don't know what's going on.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
She's the toughest to read.
This just won't work.
I don't know!
Is that all?
Why don't you get out of my face.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Follow her.
That's not funny.
You think. That's what you're good at.
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
And Dieter?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Where've you been?
Rene?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Oh, I can't.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
I have a new client.
It's just money.
And how do you service foreigners.
Oh.
Remember what?
Oh....Sure.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Just give me the keys.
What's what?
I didn't say anything.
Yes?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
It's not apparent.
You are.
You talk to yourself.
Why do you do it?
You seemed interesting.
They kidded me a little.
No.
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
How do you know you can trust me?
Beats me.
Must be a pick up, a rendezvous.
He plays it all the time.
Get us one.
You've  been there?
You coming along?
Can you?
I can't fly it.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What?
You're gonna laugh.
It was you.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
A drink...
Why not?
Just one. The back up.
Thank you.
Perfectly.
Instant rice...?
That remote control thing?
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
End up in a high profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm not touching my film...
Before you go...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Okay. 
"Mike?"
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay.  Lowell?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Okay... About this whistle blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Soy sauce...
No, thank you.
What's the difference...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Hello? Yeah...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I'm alone on this...
Alright.
I'll call you then.
Yeah.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
You eating with us?
Hardly new news.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Good.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, lots.
Everything interests me.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Yeah, great.
No.
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
There is  there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Right.
A delivery device for nicotine.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Howard!
You did good, Massey!
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
You want Botox?
We did not.
I should be in therapy.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Asian? No.
You have the pre nup?
Yes?
So, that's good, right?
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Isn't everything?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You just haven't met the right person.
Oh, I'm a lot like you  just looking for an ass to mount.
Absolutely.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Although knowing you as I do  there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin  come here right now before  just come here.
Thank you.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre  Castro Cubans.
Me. Yes.
She held that against you?
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Your mother was.
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such  volume.
What is it Miles?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Do you want to sleep on it?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms  a billiard room, a card room, a gym  Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it  and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
I bet.
May I come in?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about 
What kind of "stuff?"
That's blackmail.
Please! Leave the house.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Of Massey Myerson?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Oh, God!
Shit.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
I want to be exposed.
He's not what I expected. He's very  he's so  happy.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Rex, please.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
I'm not sure.
Video.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Video.
Sorry.
What are they?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
 the coin?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Who's Rex's guy?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
"I found a million dollar baby"
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Yes, I knowbut
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
I'll get it annulled.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Oh, yes. I heard.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Lower the boats!
No?  Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Sock her!
Yes, sir.
Yes, of course.
Any others?
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
Are you talking to me?
Wellof all thewell  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Beat it! 
Are you talking to me!
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but you've been very kind. 
Smart aleck!
The pleasure is all mine.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
Like this. I have no robe.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Um. You're doing all right.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Well, you were!
You weren't so bad yourself.
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
Why, haven't you?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
No.
That's silly.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
What?
Well, take them off.
What?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Raw?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come onget in.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
You bet I did.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Whome?  Want to see me?
Not interested. 
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry go round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Get out!
Yeah.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f a r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Well, I got it, Joe.
I am, Joe.
Well, I'll be
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
That's right.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim   only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
No, I'm not...
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63   see if it's the same guy.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
No, I did not.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
I see.  And where did you drive?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Shaw's an "untouchable", man   highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans   all Agency.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit   we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities   can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Makes sense   he's a spokesman.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
This is interesting   are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins   but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison   grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
It's incredible, honey   the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this   the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
What are you driving at, boss?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'd say the opposite   hypertension.
Who?
Allen Dulles?
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison   they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important   it's historic.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest   the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
His name?
Never touched me.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Was he there often?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair   I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know   like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Yes.
Who was there for your ass?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor  then BAM  hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Course you didn't.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to go back to work.
What time do you have to be there?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Sure.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
How was it?
They seem to like the idea.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew  So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
I'm sure.
You'll get over that.
I'm just tired in general.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Do you live together?
Not every day?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You two meet?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Who's the other one?
She told you that?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I thought you were watching him.
Gimme one anyway.
I told them.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I can do that.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
She don't know shit about the money.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Uh huh.
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Does that bother you?
Uh huh?
And your point is?
Uh huh?
All right already.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
What's your cost?
C'mon in.
Over half million dollars worth of merchandise.
What does that mean?
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou  is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
We went to the parking lot.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Tell me.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
He's a big one. You two tight?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey ass had a pistol on him.
You think you could do that?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty  five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Did the police contact you?
What does she do for you?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
She got off, huh?
Git your ass in here.
'Ola!
I was gonna tell you...
Just to see you. That's all.
No, don't. But thanks.
Stop!!!!
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
You need ... a doctor.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
He told me he was going to Hell.
How long had that been going on?
I think something's fucking connect  ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
How do you know?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Hell, you think I am?
It's freezing.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Thanks.
Don't ask.
I don't know.
Your kid dropped it off.
Why you left.
Gabe.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where are we?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
Get your clothes off.
Lie down!
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Why didn't you call me?
I don't believe this.
Stay away from me, Jez.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
I don't know.
No. I couldn't.
I don't know what to say.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
What?!
Help me!
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
He doesn't like it.
Speaking of which, duck!
Yes it does.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We're not leaving Crutch!
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
The hull's imploding!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Thorgan, suit up.
Then stop talking and work faster!
Suit up.
Not a chance.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
I hope so.
400 years in the future and these pea shooters are the best you can do?!
What if we don't?
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
I think so, why?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Oh I like her a lot.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
I'm on my way.
Well, do something!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Then open the doors!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Nanotechnology.
We've had Nano Tech for the last 30 years.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You wanna die?
Exactly.
It's okay.
Here   Take him home.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Dead astern! Zig zag!
Full throttle! To port!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town  we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Be reasonable, boys  this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Why?
Maybe we can save August...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Swell.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
Just keep kicking.
Somebody could've  I was sort of passed out.
We never had any. What's the problem?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Let me see your hands...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
And I'll drink to yours.
I think I can top that, Mister...
He's under!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
So that's cool with you, then?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona  wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
What are you talking about?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
You're not going to be a Pop Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
I wrote that.
Hey, I like this.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
You're something else.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T shirt guns at sports events.
Come on, I have something for you.
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Nothing.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Congrats.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
You're pregnant?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You mean like couples?
Well, of course. Your old D A D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
...Yeah.
He whips you?
You can?
Took 'em all.
...That's not true.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Early! Stop!!
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I do.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
I don't want to talk about it.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Why, what did he do?
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
Wasn't my fault...
What is it?
Who are you?
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
You fucked it?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Yeah.
What do you want?
What for? That guys a dick.
Den less go Joe.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
He looks like my uncle.
Darcy?
Yeah.
Bet.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
So.
Why not? You stink.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Na.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah. Do it again.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Yes.
Nothing?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
No...
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
No.
What?
You're OK?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
No.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah I get bored.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
You've heard the stories right?
Oh god. That's horrible.
Four thirty in the morning?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's grandmother style.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
To come?
Yes.
What kind of problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
What?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him  make him slip up.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No, I need the original note.
I was at the beach.
I'm positive.
Run it down.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Who is this?
I haven't got time for this.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Very good.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
No!  Wait!!
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Fuck off!
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
You're losing me.
Uh huh.
Of course.
For what?
Six, eight hours tops.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region  and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No prints.
No Frank.  No prints.
Yeah.
About a quarter to one.
We're going to work on the message.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Are we going to go through this again?
On a variation, yes  but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
What are they, please?
Yes.
How come you don't stay with them?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I don't think I could.
Another kind of game?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions  I want to keep things on a professional level.
Why?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
And you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Then show me who you are.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again  afraid of losing them.
You don't understand.
Why not?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You must move away from the Center.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Does the Queen live?
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
But there is another entrance to this place.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Yes. They will be more help than high born barons.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I chose the wrong passage.
Use your sword.
Cut. Cut!
I forbid you!
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
You will not, then?
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
What business?
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
These we'll pay for.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one eyed friend.
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
It is important to assure the succession.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
How many did you lose?
She has the power to kill.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
That is true.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Of what?
Why must you know?
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
No?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Not at all.
Good.
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
OK.
Yes.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
No.
No, you can't go out.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
What shall we do?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...Yes.
Yeah, what?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I have no fear.
Huh? Why?
Messina.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
No...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Salute.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
No it's not.
How serious is it?
I won't let you die.
That's enough.
Okay.
It's just a regular day.
We can do it together.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them  because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Show me.
You like to take walks?
Don't bring it in here  it probably has all kinds of diseases.
Where?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
If he's in trouble with the law  fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
This guy's not a murderer.
Jumped where?
By car right?
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
I told you.
So I've been informed.
Where am I?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Someone should be with you.
Forty seven years.
What do you mean?
This isn't right.
No alcohol?
No.
No.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't be silly?
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
OK.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
We?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
How much, do you think?
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I am lonely, Yuri.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty  Whitey contest. Trust me  I can handle anything.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
That's not what's important.
Whatever it is  it could save you.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
I guess.
Because they got wet.
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Just the love in my heart.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Definitely! I love him!
I'm so happy for you!
Licensed attorney or family member?
You know her?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. He has it sent out.
You think?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year  it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Thank you. I love you, too.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Thanks again for your help!
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly ing.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty  hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What happened?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything  she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now  but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too  blonde?
No.
Harvard. Law school.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Are you serious?
Why do you say that?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Do it now!
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale  skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
It's terrible.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I 
Gump, is it?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and 
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Something the matter?
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
The chill is worse this night.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Will you chance a miss?
I don't... understand.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Don't get too far!
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm sticking if you like the taste so well.
No, no, no... this is different!
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
They've fired the moat!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Be patient.
I'll go search for it.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
You've freed me, Jack...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Pinching me!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Be fair, Oona.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh, but I have.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
To Castle Couer de Noir?
A castle's but stone and mortar 
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
Mom said I should.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
What color?
And why was the alarm on?
Uh...using Josh like that.
No.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
He jumped into the ocean.
You look better without make up.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Really?
No thanks.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Why are you so stupid?
I'm not gay.
Okay.  I guess.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex husband's house, I'd worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Maybe that's too long.
I hate this job.
Yes, it is.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Thank you.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
How do you become something you're not?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
She needs to be alone, I think.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
Let's go.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
What did I say?
You bit my finger.
Left you?
What did he say?
It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't even...I'm there.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
I could use the money.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
What are you doing home?
I never asked for more.
Please don't leave me.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Take it off.
Do you like red?
No.
Yeah.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
Nigger.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Yes, sir.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks.
You went to Monroe?
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
There is no Boom Boom Room.
Oooh...
That jelly you were talking to right here?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
He even got my daddy's watch.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three legged race every year.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot licking trusty, that's all.
That was five years ago.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Goodnight, Ray.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You didn't get ketchup?
Yeah? You and what army?
I'm all right.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Made just for you, Cookie.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
He must still be in there.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Are you offering me a bribe?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Me? Willie Long.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
That's Natchez under the Hill.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
And he's dead serious.
You mother...
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
You're already there...
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not me, moron.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
What was it called, sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
By she, do you mean he?
'Bout time...
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Should we wake him up?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Peppermint... alright.
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Really?
My dad's an optometrist.
"Octopus people?"
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
I have to, Valerie.
I love you.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Where do you send them?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here  ready  fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job  protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Well... you can't have them all.
I'm fine...  See you...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after 
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Here.
Please... No.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
He was killed.
No.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You know.
All right.
I'm going to run.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
You're not going, are you?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
To what?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Yes...
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Where are you going?
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
More... many more.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little 
Too little.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Okay.
This is our bedroom.
What is?
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
And smooth... Almost no movement   back and forth, I mean.
Or not so recently?
You know what I think?
I don't know.
Over there.
We should stop seeing each other.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Okay.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Alice, I...
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
No.
The wife killer?
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
We'll get a tail put on him.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I don't know yet.
A headache?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
But my head...
A videotape.
No, nothing.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Called? When?
Just a minute.
He's got some fucked up friends.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune up?
All right!
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
What?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Whatiya mean?
It was weird...
I do like you, Sheila.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Yes. Might as well   all of it.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri  La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
A paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Good morning
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Please don't call me Lovey.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
I'm thinking.
Yes.
Sounds like a stall to me.
Just call me Barney.
Okay, Lovey.
They're very nice people   except that they've got horns.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Come on, Lovey.
In a quandary.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Bryant's Utilities   that's me.
Say, listen   will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
You have no disputes over women?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri La is Father Perrault.
The only one.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Thank you.
How can we get in touch with them?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Father Perrault is dead.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
Oh, the girl at the piano?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Right, Bob.
Come on! Quick! This way.
Aha   very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Yes.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
George. George   do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
You can't leave, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
You're wrong, George.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
We'd be eternally grateful if you
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Bump?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I'd love it!
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
English!
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Please don't go.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Cowan
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
I guess I lost:
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
I'd go with number three.
Kay...
We wear black.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I taught kindergarten.
You don't know me at all.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12 legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay that's... 444 Eyes?
Get back in the car!
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Do his job.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it
Kay!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
It's... coming.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
They're not my pals
What if I don't?
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What the hell is going on?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Anderton, leave.
Because I found out about her...
Yeah 
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Yes, you did.
How do I find the 
I can't even stand up 
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what 
Yes, sir.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Did he close the front door?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Tell me how.
That's great.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good bye, Dad...
He's alive?
No.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt  we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
If... you have one.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
The female.
You look great.
We know why John was tagged.
Sean 
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
What?
Not quite.
Yes.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
Knott!
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
To what?  Trap him?
What does he want with a precog?
What are you talking about?
You're Bobby, right?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
We have snifters
What's 'incidentals?'
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
So?
What if I gave you forty?
Manhattan.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Bullshit.
Mommy's not home?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
How could you let her see this?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
What'd you say?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
5 5 1.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Yeah.
Ruiz knows about this?
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
What is it?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing 
Where's the drop?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Soho.
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Don't be shitty.
I got no idea.
Then why do you try to get in?
He didn't say we need guns.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
What's the movie?
Nah, don't bother 
You sure?
Yeah, I guess.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Well, I don't want to walk.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
About what?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up 
The what?
We don't need guns.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You want your surprise?
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
S'up.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Why? What I say bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Watch it...
Does anyone want another?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
How's it going?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
We're square.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Heard where?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I'll take your goddam bet.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here 
Then the devil is white.
I sure met some.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Next week, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you 
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I can handle it.
Are you?
What have you set your mind to?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Shhh!
Dear heart, I love you.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Is my family here yet?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please, go ahead.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
What?
With him?
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
How long has this been going on?
What does Sidney say?
What's your story, baby?
Me?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Shorty, this is Laura.
The hell you are.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
What can you do?
So what about him?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
Allah will provide.
Am I a suspect?
What do you want?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[South America.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I show, you give me the information?
[Daniel what?]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I want you.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[And?]
[You stole the drop.]
[Don't lie to me!]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I came to visit you.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Yes or no?
Time will tell.
That's right.
No.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
No, that was in Columbia.
No.
Could I stop you?
That's not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Because...  I was already dead.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
She understands men.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
This is Mr. Creasy.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Yeah, sure.
Where?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
We just talked.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny  looking thing.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm having a very good time, too.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
I don't.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Yes, I know.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
I'll wait for your call.
Nothing.
How do you do?
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter in law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter in law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Sure.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hiya, Ralph...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care a the whole thing.
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Sure, sure.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Waddaya talking about?!!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Never this close.
Just one for a start.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve  hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Home.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Pour one for Painless.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
A football game?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short  arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Radar!
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
They're coming.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Not necessarily.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I think we could still have a chance.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight pound American Japanese male.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
That. It's out of the act.
Right, Ho Jon. See you later.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest cutter in our tent.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
You mean who hit who?
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, sir?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Captain.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
But it's ten thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
With all of it?
Against what?
Why can't you call right, you bone  headed, pig eared, lop eared, pot  bellied
John Doe, the one in the speech.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Me?
No, thank you.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Thirty dollars.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Wait a minute . . .
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
There is no letter.
In what man!
What John Doe?
So?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
I got it all ready. Here.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Yeah, a little.
Uh huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
The heelots!
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
John Doe Club?
Yeah, you bet!
How?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, I didn't.
No.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Did you want to see her about something important?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Shh!
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded  We don't know how bad it is  The guy ripped the phone out  SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
They want Walter dead!
I need to get something straight first.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Only at the very end.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
I don't gamble.
Explain how that works.
I think I can handle that one.
I'm not good at lying.
Okay, stop.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run late!
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You worship yourself.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
What do you want from me?
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Yeah that's it.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
...Let me just show you.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
A deeper level?
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Define concern.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Impound isn't a rent a car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Who's running it!
I need to take back what's mine.
Okay...
To live forever.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Not my problem.
Yes.
It's not real.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Go!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us 
It's not used for anything.
Good question.
Try harder.
No.
 Katie.
Who are you?!
Her?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Yes.
Sorry?!
There?
Checking connection.
 Waiter.
Access established.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
I've never been this sore in my life.
What does that mean?!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
We can take these guys!
There's enough for everybody!
You want me to place a few calls?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Activating Power Scope!
What's going on?!
And I ain't no nigger either!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Tell me about it.
Poor, yeah.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
You scare me, Charlie.
What's that divided four ways?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
He was around...
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I needed to see you again.
It's a mask.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
They don't give a shit about us!
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Not if they all die at once.
But that's an hour's drive.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
I must know more of you, my son.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
What about the share.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
We can operate around these guys.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Shuddup.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Yeah...before your time.
Switch hands.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Sad commentary, huh?
Why??
Bend over?
I dress up when I want to make an impression.   So how'd it go?
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors   hospitals   needles   all of it  
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am   right now.  I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
He's stuck in a loop   a nightmare loop.  Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of here...
But why me? Why'd you pick on me??
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
It looks so...new.
Stu   stop it. That monkey is good luck. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'd better go report this...
Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
What?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Uh huh?
Mother!
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Moscow.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Uh huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Those busts up thereall around the wallwho are they, sonny?
Thanks very much, sonny
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
I did not
Never.
II discussed it with himyes because Iyou see, I've always had this camp in mindbut I made no contract with him!
It couldn't be.
Yes, sir.  All right, boyslet's go.
Would you settle for a husband?
Who?
What do I play?
Frankly, kidare you goofy?
I've wondered, Dizmaybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wonderedmaybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me
And to Don Quixote!
Waiter!
Nowhow'd Humpty Dumpty get in here?
I apologize.
Have *you*?
Well, let's get going.
Take me home, Diz.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children
How do you feel, champ?
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Jimif I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees
Joe*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thingand this was the genius of the stroke*it means votes*!
Jimwhen the lightning hit, II just
Thehead?
I said, sirin my official capacity as an honorary gestureI appoint you to the United States Senate!
Is *what* getting me down?
What stuff?
Well, it sort of got to befrom Jeff just pullin' splinters and things
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. II've sorta been looking for you
For a question!
For one week!
I yield.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
No.
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it
Herewhere are you running off to?
Good as new! It's quite all right
I wish to ask the gentlemanhas he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not giveand *could* not give at that same hearing?
I will not yield, sir! This same man Mister Taylorcame here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and triedI *started* to open my mouth and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but  that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
J Jefferson Smith.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Youuhyou better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelvenoon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Why, the Billthe Billto make a National Boys' Camp...
I knowbut youyou're going to help.
Why?
We're over in the House.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now or order dinner first?
No complaints.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Go right ahead.
No!

Wait
Wellfor a couple of years nowI I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so and so, and turned away!
How are the pigeons?
Well! You don't say!
Mr. PresidentI stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my stateMister James Taylor was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.

Joelistenall Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on himhe'll fall all over himselfjust keep him out of there *one afternoon*while they read that bill
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal!
Go away, Nosey.
Oh, nowthat won't do
I see. All right. You finish this job properlyand you get a handsome bonus besides
Saundersit's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now  II've written his resignation. He resigns under protestdenying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other waybranded openly in the Senateexpelledhe'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a yearthe whole thing might be forgotten
Jim, it's just that I like the kid I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to?
Order!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
Who are you?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Deeds?
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, sir.
Yes!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I'd like to   but I have a job to think of.
Yes.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
He did?
A girl?
Oh, hello darling.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
We're not going out tonight.
It took some high powered acting, believe me.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment   in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Yes.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Come on   let's go!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why   uh
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Better wire him right away, John.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
See you later, kid.
What?
Yeah?
Yes.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Huh?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Nah.
Huh?
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Only common sense.
Entertainment?
What do they mean by this   "Cinderella Man!"
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts   and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
They can have the Estate.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Well, thanks, I   uh  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Take the stand!
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I write poetry.
Binge?
I don't know.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
What   tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Who?
What, sir?
How did they threaten you?
Take your time.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
Uh huh.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Were you supposed to have a session?
A friend?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Good, then go.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What?!
What exactly is it supposed to do?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Nope.
I thought it was  Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
A little.
I'm sorry, your honor.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Where am I supposed to eat?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
You're good.
We're going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
No, I really don't.
 the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Could I see Sofie, please?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened  when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing  I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is she against you getting help?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this  it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Disgusting.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
I don't know if 
Of course.
You're upset.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Okay...
Will you wait for me?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
It's a big part of the show.
It's my bit for the community.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
True. Should we stop them?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one  no one  asks me.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Really?
Holy shit!
You were messed up, man.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated  figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb outs, I found a place in the desert...
All new people start with that...
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Relax, I got him.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck  su namun back to life.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
None of the above, thank you.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Intestines.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
 then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Correct, And that's when 
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Proceed!
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Want to know?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
What are those mirrors for?
Preparation for what?
Who was talking about what?
How?
No you're not.
That bad huh?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got what?
I have no choice.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
What's it look like!?
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
I know you knew I'd know.
Except for one little thing.
Head hunting.
Fantasizing... about you.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
I'm his daughter.
Really?
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches 
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
He was cute though.
I thought you'd never ask.
He's dead.
Think positive.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Really?
It's home.
What have they got that we ain't got?
What are you talking about?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
My heart died a long time ago.
I say we send out the word  and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
There's a vague similarity.
So you're chicken?
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
The Eradicators!
Hey... he's gone.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman 
Sorry.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
The who?
The bazookas?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth  coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Where are they?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
A glass of champagne, please.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut  and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
All right  I promise.
Open the door.  It's me.
What are you doing in there?
Five minutes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
He's downstairs  somewhere.
What are you talking about?
I couldn't face telling you.
Yes.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace  at Schonbrunn.
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Yes, he has.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation  when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
He will stand by his agreement  I know him better than you do.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm chairs.  The amount is absurd  and, at least twice too much.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
You paid cash?
Good.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yup.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog   Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
I know, be still.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Okay, plan B.
I don't.
Ain't no windows in here.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Naw, you go first.
No.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
I don't know.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Okay.
Hold on.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
I know.
Ya'll live around here?
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
20 minutes?
I know.  I'm sorry.
What?!  This look like a 7 11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
What's the matter?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
I threw my back, again.
It's an important speech.
What's he doing here?
What happened here?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's...a comfort to hear.
That's right.
For not believing you.
Same to you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
You wouldn't...
Good.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
No, please...
Don't you threaten me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
No way.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Keep it.
I remember. The big tipper.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
What?
That's right.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Everybody does?
You're a big girl, huh?
A surprise?
Keep your eyes peeled.
Yeah.
What gives?
Yes, Dad.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Shoot, a horse hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter  I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
About what!
Sshhh! He's in there.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
A man of the Cloth?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
Amen.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Sshhh...
She's gone to Moundsville.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
He ain't my Dad.
I'll make coffee.
Is that all?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I 
NO,  it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
You could save him, little bird.
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Can I have this?
Our honeymoon.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Harry, what 
Didn't you hear me, boy?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream  their movement picks up on this 
Get the kit!
Jesus.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Haven't slept, have you?
No.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Hi.
My dream.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Nan, I 
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I won't.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Nancy?
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Put that damned thing down!
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Nobody's gonna kill you.
No more fights.
Have you any money?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
You should be more careful, Anna.
Evening gown?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Just for the honeymoon.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
No, that's bad management.
You didn't get legal advice?
Yes, Comrade?
Don't worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Good evening, Monsieur.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
No, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Count d'Algout...
Thank you, Louis.
While you eat, you look at the view.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I'll send you a muff.
No, no.
A cow?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Brave... that's right.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
That's even better.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Yes, Comrade.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
I think so too.
You're going to force us... huh?
Why should I take a chance?
Me?
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
That's great. I'm thirty five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty two pounds stripped.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old  fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I don't like your following me.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
No.
Yes.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Darling, darling... please!
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
No! No!
Much happier.
No, no music.
Good morning, Swana.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You can't imagine.
Is this your new dress suit?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
No thanks, Swana.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Hello.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
We have nothing to discuss.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
No.
Yes... leaving immediately.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Where is it?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I'll bet he would.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Mitchell?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set up.
Well, sir ... it turns out  one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
I thought the gloves were off.
The hard core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
So?
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
That's right ...
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Our own intelligence capability  to fix the leaks?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw up.  How does that threaten us?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
The only problem with that, sir  it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves  who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Jesus!
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
My friends call me "Mister President."
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department  I want to know who's talking to them.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time  two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous  "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti war vote.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember   Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours  and right now he's got the records.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
I beg your pardon 
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Yes, Mr. President.
I was the lesser of two evils.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
You need her, Dick  in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
You're shittin' me.
Ernie Davis.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Sir?
I know ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It's over, Dick.
I want a divorce.
Are you serious?
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Can I just ask for one thing?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
When?
You.  What' you're doing 
You're drunk!
Lost.
To what?
The "crises"?
Whatcha predicting  your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Who else'd be in your truck.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half wild, and some are just outlaws.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
No ID in her room?
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him  you and nobody else?
You sure?
You figure him for a dope runner?
I'm ahead of you there.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
Well I didn't see it.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yeah.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Uh huh.
You should be used to that.
Hey.
What makes you say that?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Not a bleep.
Well  where ya goin'?
You know who it is.
Yeah? Where am I?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
No. Do you?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Sir?
Sir?
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
Uh huh. Double ought.
The kind with the most poles.
No sir, it's unusual.
What room?
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
Yes?
Another additional.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What else then?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm a welder.
Yes.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
No I don't have it.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...to see you.
"Thirty two?"
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I better go check on them.
...what're you saying?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Maroon.  I stole it.
Yeah, me too.
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
You knew Del?!
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I ran back in to get the phone.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Roy! What are you doing here?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Los Angeles, California.
Did you love it?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
What's his real name?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Fine.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's his name's arm too much...
If we're for real?
I don't follow...
...and put them in your mouth.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
IT SURE IS!!
He told us it's in the Buick.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
It just didn't fit her profile...
...who doesn't?
You better believe it.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
We know that...
No! Let me try this!
Uh huh.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
No doubt, brother   I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Waitaminute  
You have eluded fate   and eluded me   for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Do not seek the treasure!
Don't know, Delmar though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para  normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision 
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Where's Tommy?
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh  reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney  toad!
Okay, Everett.
Everett, my beard itches.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Now Penny, stop that!
I'll tell you what I am   I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Don't I know it.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken   see, we've been away for several years, uh...
But... but...
Eighty four years old! I'll be gummin' pab you lum!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol' timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but 
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Blooey!
Great.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Nobody. It just came to me.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I never said any of that!
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
It's important, sir!
How're you doing, Sarge?
Pardon?
Zack, don't!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy 
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Yeah.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Let's just wait and see what happens.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've never had a girl.
When I'm good and ready.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Twenty two years ago.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
I can't risk it.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
He said he grew up poor?
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Yeah.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
It's mine.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
I know.
You're an idiot.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up and let me think.
Shit!
Adios.
Everything okay?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No ball, kid.
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of 
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Open the door.
Well, I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
Feel okay?
Shhh...
On it!
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
What if I keep dropping?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Fuck that, we've got company...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
You know it brother.
Man, El Rage is El Rage. You know him.
What's with you?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Yeah, it's me.
I don't know. Look around man.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Are you finished?
Jesus...
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
I'm down.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
They were empty...
Brimmer.
Yeah.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Just the legit shit.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Bullshit...
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
What?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
Thank you.
That would be nice, too.
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
No, he takes after his mother...
He's my father.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Apology accepted.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Prisoner exchange.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Sir.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
It's already over.
You know how old I am.
Go on.
Please.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
When?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Goodbye, Harry.
Four, five miles.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Six pounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
Well...I guess not.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet looks like she just skinned her knee.
Yayyy!
To remember.
That's enough, Ellen.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
You believe in it.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to
That roadand those Orinco trucks are the two main reasons it's there.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Does she love the cat?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Don't worry about that.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
What did we do, Jud?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come onlet's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
Yesthanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Did you see his shirt?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised
You're doing fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this
Aye, aye, sir!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Wait as long as you like.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
All right then.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Very well.
Elizabeth   Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Will  you can't trust him.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard!
He can locate Isla de Muerta  but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
 but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Will  it'll go worse for us  for Elizabeth, especially  if we fight.
Wait for my order  what the blazes is that?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Sorry, I didn't know.
Smith.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found  except by those who already know where it is.
Why ask me?
My business, Will.  As for your business  one question, or there's no use going.  This girl  what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Aye!  Avast!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Barbossa.
Depends.
 and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
No.  She hasn't.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
It's ready now, I know it is.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
What did he want?
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
Yes.
Got it.
The waste.
That's right.
No, why?
No, no, I just feel wired!
Blame the victim.
No problem.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Let's go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
And you have him?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, he might be.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No   give you another guess.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic   and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance   with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Of course I am Stewart.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things   what do you do with them?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, you can't carry a tune   you can't carry a tune   all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as   eh   just Gallagher, that's all.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What are you talking about?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Your house?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Mother!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Thanks, I will.
Huh?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well   it's only April.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
My play.
Your valet, sir.
Miss Schuyler   I mean, Mrs. Smith   she engaged me this morning, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
I hope you'll be very happy.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug   hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life   that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
And there's her mother   and what a character that old dame would make with her double strength   and that lawyer friend of theirs   he'd make a great villain   and there's you!
Very good.
Sorry, boss
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She did?
Double strength!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother  in law.
Yes, sir.
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Thanks.
Yeah ...  Thatand ...
Yes.
What?
It can't be possible.
Looks just like it did.
Hello Bill.
I think it looks nice.
Bud brought it to me.
She's crying.
Yes she is.
No ...
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh, gosh no.
I think ... I might be ill ...
It is?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Oh, no thanks ...
I'm finebut thank you.
One of those ... big beds?
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Very well ...
Well, I never had to do it before.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
The other one?
Get lost!
Youyou gotta get us out of here.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
What were you doing in a library?
Just go with the programhunh? I'm late for work.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They don't have that kind of potential.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Right.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
You don't know?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah.
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
No I won't. I swear.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
What department store did they go to?
That's right.
What the hell's going on!
Because we don't belong!
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I'm so glad you're here.
Listen to me!
Yeah ...
Ohwhat's the point, Bud?
TV repair?
What's the rush?
What happened?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You knowthis is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so  what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Ok. Thank you.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
 but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I don't know.
I'm gonna call you back.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do  you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me 
This is Georgia.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Are you watching a porno movie?
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah.....
Georgia.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Yeah.
Really? Please?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you  I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry 
Not very well.
Hi.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Really?
 well, if you're gonna go 
 oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something 
Yeah.
It's Barry.
Yeah?
Yes? I'm trying.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yes.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip 
For what?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
It's ok to ask that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok, bye, bye.
Just have you for one second, please.
You're hand is bleeding.
Why? ...what?
Please don't do this to me.
Sorry.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
What?
That's that.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I'm sorry.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
WHICH?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Where you goin?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great  you're goin  ?
What do you have in the house?
Is this where you live?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't be late though.
Don't puss out.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever 
Nothing.
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit 
Ok.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
Why not?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
Valcour. His chair.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Oh, that's rich  coming from her lapdog 
I know, because I felt it myself 
Why was it you never took her by force?
Then it must've been love 
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Playing dress up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
He's sworn to obedience.
 then I've friends of my own to visit.
That's not our intent 
What could cause a tincture like this?
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Yes?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Don't start 
There's something else I want from you.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
I pray you: be succinct.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
And I in yours.
Of course.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails 
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name 
Not you too
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Houdini mice.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I can't
And he did.
One . . . buys things.
There's nothing to explain
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending  trapped in his ridiculous
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Huh?
We're using 
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his
We're doing Hearst.
Don't do this
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
K A N E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Uh huh.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Christ.
Yeah, you're probably right.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
CITIZEN KANE
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this
Please don't ask me to do this.
I don't want to sit
It was fun, wasn't it?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want
Yes!
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else  you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What?
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid  a great piece of ass.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her, were you?
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
You want the title shot or not?
This Janiro's an up and coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left  they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up and  coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own  just like you want it. All right?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
No, I just told you what happened.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Whatsa matter with you?
Does that mean...
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Can you see it?
No.
Come over here.
Come here.
I'm not interested in him.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
All I did...
Yeah 
Tell him how you feel  you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Are you drunk?
What friends?
Never felt better.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Jefferies?
But his leg!
Namely?
When the lock is broken  yes.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
She  was  an  invalid!
I was jaywalking.
What time?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Doyle  are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Mrs. Thorwald.
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
You figured that out, huh?
That depends on who "they" were.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Where'd they take Lisa?
For getting rid of that cast.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Well  you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Why should I?
How?
It crashed, didn't it?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I don't want to.
She's all right.
Stella!
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
How did you know!
Depends one which one.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's probably one in the basement.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm  hurts a little.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
For what?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain 
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Someone not his wife?
I don't know.
Thinking about Thorwald?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You mean  like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Jeff  if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Lisa  I  I  can't tell you how scared I was that you  you might 
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Give me some dirt.
Somebody find him a knife.
Stay there.
Hi.
Okay.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
No
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Hold it, Jim.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Well, now
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe meyou're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Will you wait a minute?
Sorry.
Have some cigars.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
What's the charge?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Hi there.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go  go go!
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wow!  Well now there then!
When was that?
Plato!
I'm here.
I'm fine.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back
Grandma?
No.
Leave me alone.
Mess that kid up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Chicken?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Now that's true!
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where what was.
Won't mother be proud.
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10thWant to carry my books?
A what?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do kill myself?
No.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know.
You don't need to do that.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with himand fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likeshe lets call him "Jamie."
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
He hates me.
He hates me.
Yeshe started yelling for a handkerchiefscreaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick offhe rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at methat thingthe thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
I'll never get close to anybody.
My mother?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
We were romantic then too
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Hi.
What?
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
To all those cons...
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to 
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
We could live it up and 
Nick, I love you 
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick, the ice is 
You saved me.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
I'm almost done.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick 
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I never worked at no casino.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
At least gimme video poker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country western funeral.
Don't tip.
Nothing... I promise nothing...
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Leave the tree.
I don't know... what you're...
What... Powwow...
GO!!!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
Hi, Nick.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Fuckin, Zookerman 
I'm just saying.
Thought you hate your old man.
What, working security?
Good for you. Protein.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing 
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
But... I had a five...
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Fine, now.
You ain't dying, he is.
Who?
Was he all pissed off?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
How do you know all this?
What?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
How can you tell?
Did the two of you talk?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What for?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it!
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What do you care?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
It's a surprise.
You didn't ask.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
I can' take you to a hospital.
Lie back down, and try to  
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uh uh, just cops.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger happy?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a  
That was the plan, we meet here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful  
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
As far as  Sonora?
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
And look at it this way. How about Jim  it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
Will she be dark or fair?
Maybe it's better that way.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
That's right  worry about your clothes 
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Why?
Which ranch?
Like what?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
That's right, Steve.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty  two's more your size.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
You remember Jeff Rawson?  We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
You better start.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
So  maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Nobody asked you to.
I don't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Darling  now I've got you all upset.
I like it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Well, say it.
Depends on how good you drive.
They shouldn't have done that.
I don't like to see you go.
Maybe in Sonora.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
That's the end of the line.
There's plenty of use for reading  you'll see.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse  with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Would they be good to eat?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Steve 
I think he wants me.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hello Ray.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Yeah.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Alright!
Hugh Kane.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I don't care. You pick.
It's okay.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
I don't need your help.
We? What do you mean... we?
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
That one.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
That's right.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Father, come in, please.
No, I'm fine.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Get out?! What does it say?
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
You don't think...
MURDERED?!!
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
Thanks, Mom.
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
But, Chip...
That's right.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Oh, honey!
Yes, I did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
It's not fair!!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Yes, I was.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
...Browsing.
Right here!
He's a good boy.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and 
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
You think my sister is there?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants  and things, I want to go there.
Which room is it?
I'd like to get out of here.
Yes, I understand.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
She can only use cash.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
But I like teaching school.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Good night.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
I'm looking for a party  a merry party.
We could tell him.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi  I'm dying.
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
I won't get lonely.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I can imagine.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I understand.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What a peculiar question.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Tell me what?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know 
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez   this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
You know where she is?
It seems right to us.
Thank you, my dear.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
What did he say?
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
When?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
What about Judd  he knows about us.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide     of ending your life when you wanted to.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
What's the first?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Agreed.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Ann. Hello.
What kind of personal project?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I'm sorry this came up.
Why not?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Absolutely not.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you lied to her?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig 
No.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Why not?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
You did that?
Are you having an affair?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
He does.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Is he still at your house?
Did you find him attractive?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, what, then?
What kinds of questions?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
There's a phone here.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Yes.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
Okay.
So make an exception.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
In here!!
Oh.  Well, when, then?
I want to see you.
Cynthia. John.
You told Ann about this?
You trust him.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Will you lease month to month?
You were prying before?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yes?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Was he nice to you?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
OK. But late.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Just breathe normally.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
It looks like  and I quote  'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
I am in Farley's employ  and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it, Ralph!
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Farley!
Flavors!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
We're not confused.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
What are you pouring tonight?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Highliner.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Stephanie.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Well, in that case...
Yeah, Conundrum.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I'd rather have a knife.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Let me call Christine.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
It's not even a mile.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
If that's what feels right.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
What?
Well, she is cute.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Aye aye, captain.
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
She's been leaving messages here too.
What?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Understanding of what?
In love? Twenty four hours with some wine pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Yeah.
Nope.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
What exactly are we going to do?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
It's private.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Yeah.
The plan is... you go.
I'm fine. You rest.
You need a new car anyway.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
The Windmill.
Try it.
That's what I'm having.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
What was the bottle that did it?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
What rehearsal dinner?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Ken.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So how're you doing?
I guess.
See you over there, Miles.
About four weeks.
About a year.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
It tastes old.
I heard them Morgan.
My ballet recital.
Me too.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
They already know we're here.
From what?
Have they said anything about our area?
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Graham.
Yes.
I have some upstairs.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Don't call me Father.
The footprints.
There are none.
I would say so.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Why not?
You'll lose the signal!
What book!
Your next water ain't for three days.
McKendrick.
I'm sorry.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
This is a brutal land.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
That I do.
No, Leavenworth.
I had to get up anyway.
Where's the pinto going?
Which way do you mean?
I understand.
No hard feelings.
I've got a job.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down  just like these cattle.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
We didn't get that far.
Really?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
It's none of your business.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Where's Emmett now?
I heard that too.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good bye, Cobb.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
So called?
Why'd you go into business with him?
Who's the owner?
Who?
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up front salary, back end deal, perks, per diem, percentages  They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to  more than once!
You can have everything  office, car, assistants  all I want is the picture.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor  I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
"Forever".
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I'll send you her resume.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Oh, make it live  please, Viktor.
She said you were very beautiful.
I do?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
When is she coming over?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Not if I don't let her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No... it's life.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Just a minute.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Is that a problem?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Clyde.
It was more in passing.
How did the wall get there?
I know what you mean.
I need flesh and 
 You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything  unusual?
If anyone asks about Simone 
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I could get the death penalty.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
 I bet you have.
Abduction?
Don't you?
Why?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
What do you want  ?
 Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning  worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape  we'll get our money back  maybe show it on an exclusive pay per view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Is that why she left you?
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You know what I'm talking about.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk  life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
No, just one.
Congratulations.
That I'm a freak.
Upset words.
I forgot myself.
Dr. Crowe.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know, Cole.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
No, we're not.
You do?
Yeah.
Ghosts.
They want me to do things for them.
...I don't know.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Who!
S ssstop that!
S ssssstop it!
Meaning?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Book of Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again.  Who are you?!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
This is his room... isn't it?
"Blood?"
Who? Us?!
You got something against farm people, Keith?
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Nothing to tell.
Billy Bob's dead.  We were wrong  he didn't do anything. I It's the scarecrow 
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester  it almost got me.
It's you. You and your father.
Don't look.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
What'll we do?
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
You took Bill.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant, no!
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
They're both a challenge.
Would I lie to you?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
He's after us again!
Yeah.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Weight Station.
See ya, Kate.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
I'll do it.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Running blocker.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
I'm cucumber cool.
What's that, pardner?
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Go head on, breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Chickenshit money.
 Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
 Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so
Of course. Yes.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah, uh  it was Spanish somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh 
 he was wearing one of our jackets.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah, why.
Then what 
I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard ons about it  make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides 
I thought Heller was a double op?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
 will be handled back in 
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we 
Nah, nuthin' on my end 
 okay, g'head 
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
A million flat.
Well, uh  damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that  where does that leave us?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
I can trust Rheya.
You're not Gibarian...
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
What?
How much sleep?
What was it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Yes.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I won't be making the trip.
Why?
Yes.
Book?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment to  moment, and not let it destroy us.
I want you here.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
You must have been dreaming.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Beg pardon?
I got money.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Urdu and Hindi.
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Claire...!
Let go!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
They called here after you left...
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
Pretty bad.
Yeah.
I know.
I don't know...
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Nothing.
Sure we are, let's go!
Too kinky.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Oh, some shit.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Why?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety seven five right?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
You talked to his wife?
I'm all right.
Me neither.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up 
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green eyed monster...
You stop him?
No, no.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not
I was sort of hoping to get out of
They'll never take me alive.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really
Right.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just call me Spidey.
Well...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Thank God.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself   and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It'll shut itself off.
How is he?
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Oh I don't know thanks, Mr. Reiss, but
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables
Is you all little Adolfs?
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
That'll do.
In this barracks?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
You stink, Sefton!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured  eh, Duke?
That's right.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
I'll call the whole pot.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie  get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to 
Twenty five.
What is your number?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Abfuehren!
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
What's the award?
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do they always say?
You want to go?
Yes, sir.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Good.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Are we boring you?
Says who?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You told them, Hoffy.
Uh huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
What time?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little  just out of decency?
Ich weiss alles.
Here. Take them.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Not particularly.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
He is.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
I believe so.
I believe so.
You get what?
The station complement was nineteen.
I hope so, sir.
All hands, brace for impact!
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yes, where would you go?
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of 
Better?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
No.
No, I didn't know that.
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene  my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless  I am reading a life form there.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Nothing. As before.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty  two point two Celsius.
A photon tube...!
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
... How long?
I'll go...
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
I know, but  let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Sir...?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I'll need it, Sulu.
... A cloaking device?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd stay there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage 
Any time.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
You fool  look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Success, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically 
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say 
And who am I hiding from?
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
Ah.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re opening old wounds.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Mother, go back!
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Ssssh!
What's the matter  ?
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I see. Helmsman?
We were still there, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room 
She's making it up! My father was Professor 
Full power damn you!
Aye, sir.
Scotty, let's have it.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
The power of creation 
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It would explain a great many things 
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to 
Who the hell are they?
It's all we've got.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
At what.
Aye, sir.
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir 
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Engage warp engines 
Try again.
Battle stations.
I'll try, Captain.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
By the book...
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake  made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one  you  was more important to them.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
I liked him better before he died.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
... Best shot...?
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
No, my name.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage  but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
How soon?
You've already been that. C'mon.
In fact, we may be able to help  in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Just lucky, I guess.
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch up learning to do.
Don't worry. I'll find you.  See you around the galaxy...
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
What are the variables...?
How do you know this...?
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
The hell I can't
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non functional.
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de cloaking  Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Picture, Uhura!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
On screen.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
No power to the bay doors.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Millions?
... Yes?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis  taken me for someone else.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
But not you.
... an offlander?
I'll be here.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
You're what?
I understand.
Perhaps, that is true.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Captain, Geordi...?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Understood.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
If a court martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three micron mis  alignment...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
On screen.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
We won't be able to go any faster than one third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Aye, sir.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one third. Take us in.
Sir?
Decloak the holo ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
Yes...
Jean Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
No... no, please... you cannot...
What?
I am the Borg.
How serious is the damage?
There should be some kind of manual release...
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Always am.
Engage.
We're crossing the threshold!
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
The invasion plans.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that 
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
'Fraid not.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress  nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
What are you suggesting?
Commander... we have a problem.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Come on...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
That's a comfort...
I beg your pardon?
How can I trust 
He just tried to save him!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But  
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Now we go to Starfleet?
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Do we report this, sir?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Except us.
Energize...
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman    ... so I volunteered.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Sulu!
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
He was just about to explain the whole damn  
What peace conference?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Who else?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Faith...?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Such things have happened before, sir.
I don't want to.
You've betrayed the Federation   all of you.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
This one can.
Yes, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Is he very much like you were?
It would appear so.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
You are not looking at your  self. You are looking at me.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly.  It could head this way with  out much warning .
An individual more like you, you mean.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Emergency force fields are holding.

The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
How could I not?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I know how he thinks.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
What do we know about the planet?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Just lucky, Admiral.
If you don't mind.
Your new chair, sir.
Still well on our side...
Thank you, sir...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Counselor?
And the Romulans invade.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
I know.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
You're not Reman.
We are.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Please.
It is... invigorating.
Find her again.
She is here.
None.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Silence, Romulan!
I don't want to scare them away.
How much are your rooms?
I'll have to run your card off now.
It's still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
I understand.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
It's in a green Mustang?
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
What?
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Marc Shermin.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
What.
Ah no.
Eh... police.
Good.
Smile.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Space?
Shit?
You better.
I do not understand.
Yes.
No.
Why?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch hiking right away and...
I am your friend.
Why?
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I can't stay on this planet.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You're damn right I am.
Nothing.
Do they talk?!
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
Many, many days and nights...
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Call the police!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
In the cars, too?!
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Yes.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
I wouldn't think so.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
No problem.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Can't do it.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Shutup a second!
Not now... I don't want to think about it
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
I intend to.
Where's Faith?
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Mace!  You're a life saver.
Coming with you.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex  husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid head low life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
I've never dealt in black jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire freak gets to keep running around
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You sure?
Well, look at the plus side.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
You never told me.
No, it's not.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
See you downtown.
Aw, Mom!
Take the tape to the cops.
Um... he was older.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What's the bad news?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine tooth  comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What are you doing?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Then why do I still have a badge?
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
How long ago?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
There's a killer out there  we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper 
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer  and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I know.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What did you tell him?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
You did.
Not the way I can.
Jaime? Where are you?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Yeah, of course.
How are we going to find him?
No weapon.
I'll be back.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior  no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Zero killed them all?
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Lead the way, Murman.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[You tell me.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
What did you do to end up here?
Sounds like fun.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
I know, I know.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
What do you drive?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...and even then...
What an asshole.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
...Six months.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
I thought you met someone else.
Really?
I heard you might be moving back...
Right.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
What do you want? You're tall.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
What'd you get?
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
Classy.
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah, there's the rub...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
So, what? Eleven?
...People get carjacked...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213  555 4679... 
I just got out of a six year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Hang on, Voltaire.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Whu?
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit boss on us?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yea, how much?
Let's go.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Leave? The honey baby's bringing us some cocktails.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
...gotta...
What?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
No, baby!
A day.
Oh. He's got it under control...
...It's on.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
True.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
America has been good to me...
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Ba Fa Goulle.
No, just you and Paulie.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
We gotta move...
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Maybe I can help.
For bravery.
I'll need him.
Yes.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Where are you going?
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Shhhhh.
You look good, too.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Okay.  One minute.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Mama, no.
Thanks Tom.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Michael, I love you.
How do you do.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
No.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I'm busy.
Don't ask me.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Thanks.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Marge! You've got to hear this!
No, I think your mother, her illness 
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Sure. I love Venice.
A few places  that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see?  fine, vulnerable  that's pain, that's secret pain.
No!
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Do you even like jazz  or was that something for my benefit?
I love Marge.
What evening?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Far cry from New York.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's  he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I'm sure we've met.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Frances?
What does that mean?
Is that what he said  he wanted to be alone?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just  you're way ahead of me! Great!
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face  they find out he hit me  he's got a temper  he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now  a Mr MacCarron  Dickie's father's employing him.
He's having an early night.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's  I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
No glasses.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
Excuse me?
As in the...?
Randall.
What?
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Peter Smith Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
But the point is Dickie  well we know this  Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful  it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
It's okay.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Peter, I... I...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Postmortem?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even your fiance...?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit  so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Yes, mam.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement  no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
What?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Thank you, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
You sure he's not Italian?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Show me how he did that again.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
What did you do?
One Ball McCall?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
I don't like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
I can leave anytime I want.
That's not hard to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
It's all I could think of.
It's about time.
Partners.
What's that?  Mason?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
I am, too.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
That always used to work.
You mean,  me?
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
How'd they get it inside?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh...
What?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
Oh.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Start with what you knew then.
I'm not refuting anything.
I do.
I... I need a drink of water.
What's that?
Thanks.
Can't wait.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
They're...
Oh, no, I...
Dad, I...
Six thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Pete...
No, sir.
Call me... Ishmael?
What's his rent?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Yeah, well, that's enough.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Oh...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him  love.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty  five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Just listen to them!
I don't think your mother would like that.
I don't know yet.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Shhh. Shhhhh.
That's where the Brenners live.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
It's nothing.
Birds are not bad!
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I'm simply quoting the law.
I told you. We met yesterday.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I know, Mother.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Oh, my God, look at her!
You're doing fine.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Yeah, and the freeway's well lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Yes.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I don't mind, really.
We know what it is, Al.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
How can you tell?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Yes.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
I wrote the letter.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Yes.
Cheers.
What do you do?
I'm glad you do.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Inland.
Maybe.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Mitch...
You said three o'clock.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Do you have any lovebirds?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
No one called it a war!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I'm not sure, but...
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
MacFarlane
Where can I find him?
From the Municipal Council  they're the bodies of paupers 
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Grave robbing is one thing  this is murder.
Wait, Doctor  wait!  The child's fainting.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
A burial party  poor people  it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
It was a woman when we put her in.
He was a nice horse.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid of what?
I am the best man for the job.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
The nerve centers  the brain 
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I know 
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph.  I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back 
You can get out.
I'll get him.
Tell her... we'll get him.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
The scar.
How can you die if you're already dead?
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
Yes I do, I really do.
My father.
It's not. I can't take it.
I know.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
I want you... to bend over.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About you.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White  and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested  or if you intend to turn me over to your Army  we needn't waste any more time.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I come to you as a last resort  and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I assure you such power exists.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
No  I'm afraid not.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
Yes  I think so.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
All right.
Why not, Bobby?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah  sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why  the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third class witch doctor.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I  I'm afraid I can't  not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
All right, Tom  it's true. I know it's true.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Where is the meeting going to be?
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
No  I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
How long will that take?
Get going, will you, Brady  before I get mad!
We don't ride with vampires.
El Vampiro.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Why?  They're only noodles.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
Yeah.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
What?
Your dog knows flesh eaters when he smells 'em!
Closet monster!?
Did we have a date tonight?
I better get cleaned up, then.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Smells like something died.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
 I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Mom!
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Boy!  Somebody areound here sure has bad breath!
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I hope so.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys  as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Okay.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Take laddie.
So do I!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Nowhere.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Piss off.
Don't turn on the light.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I don't know.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody  I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
I don't know who to trust.
Now who'd go and do...
Let go of me...
Was dark... find a light...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Look, I'm just guessing...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
That's good enough.
But...
What for?
I think so.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Well, stick to it.
No.
Damn if I won't.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
The generator!
So what do you make of it?
Who else could have used that key?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Can you show us where they live?
What?
It was meant to.
This way.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
End...?
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
I  what are you?!
Got here as soon as I could.
I mean... well... affection.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I've seen it.
Let them.
Tonight's the night?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment  I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I don't understand.
Yes...
Mm.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
You can see so many here.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Thank you.
You lost someone.
Mara...?
Ouch  all right, wish me luck.
Tell him to go away 
May I get you some 
Exactly correct, sir.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you 
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations"  even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
I took a different route.
New Yorkers.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're here!  They're inside the house  !
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
For our sake, I hope not.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Depends on what you're seeing.
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
My business?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No, we were patients.
He didn't either.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Yeah.
What?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
They're not.
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
No, he didn't.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
It doesn't look all that different.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Who told you this?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Sure.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
I'll manage.
You remember it?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe  but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
What.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Yes, baby?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
In the leg.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
It's him.
A .38.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I'm a robber.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Why now, Jimmy?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Okay.  I will, too.
How come he let you go?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Isn't this fun?
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Yeah!
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Get the car.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
So this is all my fault, is it.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Why are you actin' like this?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Lemme see the map.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Try to.
Yeah.
You're right.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Harlan.
About how fast was I going?
I believe you.
Just asking.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We can change our names.
You're drivin'.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
Oh.
You too, sweetie, the best.
How do you stay so positive?
Where?!
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Grrrreat!
Fresno.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
You sent that?
Woogie, I caught you red handed.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Never?
I don't know.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume  like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Out getting coffee.
Big guy  goes to Barrington high school.
'That right?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
You found my car?!
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Dumbshit.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
Some buildings I'm working on.
That sounds like fun.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Great.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces  look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? She's not my grandmother  actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day  just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Have you seen it?
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Well, I know you're busy...
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
So she hasn't changed?
Huh?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kim and I are close friends!
You mean him.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Future wife? Get real, man  you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work  out.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half mile radius.
He's no Steve Young.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
He's dead.
Oh... are you... ?
Thanks.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
What are you?
I like it. And think of the toppings  cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
You forgot your keys!
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I think a little of both.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No, that's really unneces 
Giddy up.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
So if there are alternatives that make sense  and I'm not saying there are  we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We've got bigger problems right now.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Something your father would've come up with.
 Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
 You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Still heading for Cuba.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
He was.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big time.
You're sure...
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs 
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Good. Thank you.
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't 
Yes.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I 
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
You're steppin' on sign.
Bullshit.
 his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted  a trickster.
Go back to your DNA finger printin'.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands  the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over  it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk  ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
A what?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Crow Horse, listen 
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Sorry.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Wa shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Come back?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
 yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
It's classified.
You know. The finger.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
I'm special.
Evan... or Maverick.

You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Why?
What do you want?
Hardly ever.
How does it go?
True.
Who's gonna win?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir!
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
He better be kidding!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Roger, I've got it.
But I have to!
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
On what?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Yeah, he's marriedbut then again, he,s not dead.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I've had enough...for now.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
They should have warned you about that one.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
That's because you don't have any women.
SHIT!!
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL  I'M COMING IN.
So have I.
Three guesses.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Then why are you here?
My wife's house.
I'm nothing like him.
The Last Resort.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Definitely.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Don't be an idiot.
It's about goddamn time.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
That's right.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
O.K., everybody pull out!
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Oh, Rekall.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got Quaid.
Come on!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Do what?
Lori, move.
I'm late.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
You went to those brain butchers?!
Doug...
I'm honored.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You're gonna love this. We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Blondes.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
I think I scared it!
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Sons of bitches!
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull anything.
You are so full of shit...
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
Absolutely.
Let go of my hair.
Sustained.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
 I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Shut your sewer mouth!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing  but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can describe it.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves  did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
No. No...
Of course.
Look  I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
Roger Baron.
That's why I hate experts.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look 
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
I'm not that desperate.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
 Me? Neither.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one  it's all in my report.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
How can I tell you what I don't know!
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
See cil.
I always t tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Objection.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
 Eddie told you?
Shouldn't one of us...?
 Why don't you ask Chuckie?
And its purpose?
I'm a soldado in the G Wing Regiment.
Shu's the only one I know of...
No! They g got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Blonde.
I want you.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
I think that's a good idea.
She's wearing a ring.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
When?
I don't know what to do.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
No, you're the muffin.
No.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Maybe.
I already made you two tapes.
Hey, Jacques...
What? She asked about my father?
Let's go all the way.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
You mean the ones you pity.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Sex?
They were looking for wood.
Fish eyes?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom... what are you wearing?
It's a school night... back by nine.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Not really.
A friend from school.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
That's right.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy  eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes. It would be.
You've just said you signed it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
No.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Yes.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
Hold on a second.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Well...
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...things change.
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard  ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
Who told you that?
Mr. Alito, please.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
I didn't do it, Mister.
It's locked.
...I understand...
Yeah.
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well  they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Admittance form is wrong.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I'm swell.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Huh.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
I'm looking for some Pacific Tech professors...
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I liked him.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
I couldn't see much in the dark   but it was one!
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
It might give us something.
It was nearer than that.
Welcome to California!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's very excited about it.
What?
You get any sleep last night?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Chase. Hi...
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Finish, please!
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Not sleepy.
Your bed?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Read me some?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
And how about your co star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Your father?
You miss him.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Yes sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
No, I can't.
What do you mean?
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
What was that?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Because it looks good.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
What's the difference?
Yes.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Yes sir.
Face what?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
So is violating international law.
Twice.
No.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
And, of course, we are.
Why are you here?
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They'll know about it in the morning.
She's Cuban.
Why'd you jump?
I couldn't do it.
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I don't have to listen to this.
Outer.
No.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
I'm sorry...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
This be it?
We don't have no paper bags.
You used the toilet, now you can go   what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Ready for another?
She really say she was pregnant?
No, of course.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin'   get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Thanks.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Muchas gracias.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
That bastard Pucinski...
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
And?
Peanut...
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Here she goes again...
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
You up for that?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Uh huh.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
That'd be good, Lula.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
Yeah?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Got any plans?
What if I told you not to?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Santos...
Shoot him.
No.
No... But...
Santos... I can't...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
So?
I didn't see nothin'...
Thanks...
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
So I hear.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Shut up and drink.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a  from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Because... because...
Tripp.
Where would we go?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Ye es?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and  well  I was pretty bent in general.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo  Faulknerian nobody.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
'Fraid so.
A little.
Heaven?
Like the lady herself.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
You're welcome.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
What'd he say?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but 
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people  some of the kids in workshop  thought maybe you were...
Well done, James.
I never heard of it.
Kinship.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I never said that.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Yes, James.
Do?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet 
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
That good, huh?
I got the message you called too.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
A twelve year old policeman came by the house this morning.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
I think I might have.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Oh?
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
It's Grady, Walter.
I have... eight fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Give me a break, Grady.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
K through sixth.
It's a nice table.
It wasn't like that.
Next week? The week after?
Isn't it?
You don't have to tell me this.
Birds.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not yet.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
They grow outside, don't they?
Yeah, Mary Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
Your daddy will always love you.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
That was a joke.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Of course.
I don't need someone else.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I want to talk about it now.
Sorry.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I was six years old!
Are you okay?
I like the noise.
I get that impression.
You're still here.
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
You don't really 
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
What's it look like?
Nothing.
Piece of cake, baby.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Yeah, what's his name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
It's trying to communicate.
They'll come out after us.
How?
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're
What's the plan?
Tell me later.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Turn it up, bozo.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
He's hallucinating badly.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
You already know what they are.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It takes about twenty to twenty two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
No.
But then when will we see each other?
But just think  the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
It was futile. We went all over.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Here I am.
And where do you find the models?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
I don't see why I should mind.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
They were stained.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I love you.
At least once a week.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
And what did you do?
In the middle of all the pain?
The baby they made up.
Agnes...
I can't have them any more.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Somebody told her.
You'll laugh.
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Because I don't want one.
A mistake...
I'm not sick.
I can't.
Yes.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
No I'm not.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
May I open my eyes now?
I ate.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
What did she mean?
Who?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Why?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Thanks...
You got to be crazy.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
No one.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Obviously there was.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
So, someone else could have done it.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
And what happened?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas  sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
There's another choice.
Nothing.
Yes.
What is it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Nothing...
Hand rolled.
For the Church?
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
I didn't guess until it was too late.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Shurrup!
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
How about Ding Dong?
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
I'll have a bash.
I don't care.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
It is, y'know.
No, straight up.
He's sulking again.
We do.
He hasn't.
I'll look in here again.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
No.  I'm a walk on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
The big hammer?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
See you.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Nothing good.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
You're left handed, aren't you, Paul?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Ah, go on, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
What?
I'm not, no.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Well ...
He'll get over it.
Don't exaggerate.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
Clever.  George.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Get knotted!
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
A proper Aborigine.
Kill drive engines.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
... I don't know...
Receiving.
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
Take a look.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
I don't know... I'm getting these CRAMPS!
What?  Why?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Don't know  maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Right.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Oh  I'm not near ready yet.
Right.
Well we better do something.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful  it's huge now.
No, I don't want us separated.
Right. 
He's the only one that knows that.
It wouldn't come.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it  it might jump on us 
How's Broussard?
Good.
Sounds like a rough one.
I'm trying.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey!  what about the film?
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
All right, then  when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Look 
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Turn on navigation lights.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good!  Moisture content?
Oh well... you know me.
Good.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
I guess we open the door and net it.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more  we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Go ahead, Jay.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Doesn't matter  we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
What can I do?
Sure.
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Thanks.
Oh man...
Better tell the boss.
Too many.
Keep trying!
Shit.  When?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra orbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Match it!
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Yeah, I...
It's alright, it's cool...
Where does that lead to?
What's the problem?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross reff them through?
Get off an all bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Compensate!
What?  Why?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  Auto shop, you all set?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
And before that?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Check out the tent.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
I... I can't!
No!
You should hit the sack, too.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I call myself Phoebe.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
It wasn't meant to be.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
I'm in love with Lloyd!
... and Karen.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
What of it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support   moral or otherwise.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday   Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Thank you so much.
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Huh?
A big hurry, be quick about it   so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Sing it?
I get a party, don't I?
She hasn't missed a week since I left   but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask   check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
See you...
She's a girl of so many interests.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection   and so young. So young and so fair...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I've been aware of that for some time.
But if I tell you it is   as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Glory Hallelujah.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes Barre.
You know what I'm going to be?
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown up women only, I might even play a mother   only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
You didn't have to tell me.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
What did you expect   live sables?
Buy some.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Night an' day.
Like an agent with one client.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Miss Harrington...
Probably not.
I might.
You rest. I'll get it...
He's the best.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I don't let myself think about it, even     but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl     but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I don't intend to be.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things   that they were all Addison?
Let's not get over dramatic.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
But not all of it   not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other   with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Really, Eve? Why?
Why not?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
I'm so happy you're happy.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet 
Three or four miles...
It doesn't matter.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart   how can he?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now   Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Isn't that what they always say?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
With tears.
Loud.
Up to here! That's where I've got it   up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical 
Then a childish, heavy handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy 
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Where'd you get all that information?
That was a pity...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
With gestures, of course.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Not much.
Nothing...
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
How do you mean?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
She was a revelation...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I just played it.
How about me what?
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
it was bullshit the way it was
you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale
they're all the same, all those Ivy League placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart
Yeah?
Let me lay a little theory on you
a spy, you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
see?
she was panicked, Carlevery time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
You're not a kid anymore.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
Nixon.
Go on, go on
we will
shit, who do we know?
I haven't said anything
Haldeman I know, who else?
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Who?
It's nothing personal, though. 
Deep Throat won't confirmI never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Goddamnit!
Whatever.
This?  Naw...
Any idea what he did?
They never told me anything except my own roleI had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
Chapin did contact you then?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
At USC, you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
that was awhile ago
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two day period six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore  I think the place is bugged.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
I will not talk about the other two.
RoutineI'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
all non denial denialswe're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this
you double checked both sources?
his dialing finger must be falling off
Electronic surveillance.
I'm not here.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a daywe've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been foundthere was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
To where?
I know what it meansSegretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Who?be specific. How high up?
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief.
The C.I.A.
I'm Woodward.
I think so.
nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions
You can't believe that.
Lotsa hints
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Hunt is Colson's man  that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel  they both went to Brown University  Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break in.
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Larry Young, a California lawyer
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
One thing I'm not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Sorry, coach.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Mister Finch  are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Uh huh.
Really?  Hey, thanks  Heather, right?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You talked to Stifler?
What?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Sure.
I couldn't tell  She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Dad, come in.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Michelle.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
I told you.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Okay!
A hot cartoon.
No  Kevin, you?
"Fun loving"  insane.
Oh  no way.  I can't do that to her.
So do I, Kev.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Move with the music.
Nadia, I can't 
Oh no.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
You think so?
Vicky  do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Not for you.
How?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
You want to do it?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, right here.
I don't know.  How do you?
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?!  How do I do that?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys  you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it 
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I think we're falling in love.
Dude, he does not.
Keep it down, dude.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.
No shit.
No way.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Yeah. Apparently.
What?
Come on. I'm from New York   the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc   I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Fuck me...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Shit!
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
And you call me a moron...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Oh no... no....
What about me?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine  like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look  
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
He says  
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I know, but I had to because . . .
I'm not sure but look. . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I'm fine.
Who's Sophie?
What happened to your parents?
You know, it's strange   Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too   can't remember. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
Trying... to... breathe...
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Don't be
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Oh, yes, Grandmama   I wait until I hear...
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness"   we should start getting used to saying it.
Pray he's color blind...
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
What I foundyour was your granddaughter!
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
If they they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
How can you possibly oversleep?
What what what what's the matter?
M'm.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y y yeah, just for fifteen years.
M'hm...
Neat, yeah.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I  Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Yeah.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Yeah?
M'hm.
You are extremely sexy.
Uh... uh, you're you're exceptional in bed because you got  you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
Mine.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
It's it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl  You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I I'm suffocating you?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oh.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It's for my complexion.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think 
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I I can't win.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Well... H h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah, and I I tru  you know, I trust her, because my my analyst recommended her.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and  and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Why are you so hostile?
Don't get upset!
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
My head is throbbing.
Well, I'm I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
What are you depressed about?
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me  I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Hey.
May I see your license, please?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the  with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
She was stealing.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat  looking and he was emotional... Y  hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Hi, I'm I'm Tony Lacey.
Are you... are you recording? Or do  Are you with any label now?
Hey 
I was a great beauty.
I was very charming.
A long time.
And you've only just met.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Leo?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Of course.
Don't you miss it?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Yeah.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Leave us alone right now.
We live next door.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Fantastic.  Out here.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did you invite them?
Just do what I say, alright?
Beats a lawsuit.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel.
Hardly...
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty fucking two?
Really?
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Otis!!!!
Rave parties?!  That's so typical   you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Your director and your co star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
You changed your mind.
You're not ready.
I guess.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that 
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
No you're not.
Hm.
What?
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon.
And he doesn't smoke?
I'm sure you understand.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Why?
Don't go in, Ryan.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center   at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Thank you.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
You see, that's worse.
Like your business managers?
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
That's not an answer, is it?
I guess.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Rose.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And here they are!
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Neither does Joe.
Why are you doing this?
Invisible!
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Divinely?
Quiet  sshhh!!
How should I know?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  That direction.
I ruined your life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you  alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable.
Come on  it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Well...no, but 
There's something going on, Z 
You did?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Superior numbers, kid!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
No  I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Princess!  You look  outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
That's correct, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know why there's a food shortage?
Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby pamby workers live it up back home.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Can't we all settle this like adults  we're not larvae anymore 
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me  bingo!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
My mother.
Yeah.  How much?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger  but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Well, I have some paper towels 
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Great. Look  have you seen The Music Man?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first  and then 
Well  I could meet you at the theatre  if that's all right.
How is your cold?
Oh.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
After all, this is a conservative firm  I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer 
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind  this is sort of personal
Two o'clock.
No  it's my stomach.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I'm not very good at it.
Pick a card.
Gin.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband  he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated   but I flunked the typing test 
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly  if you did something like that  you'd hate yourself.
Who'd care?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook  but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
No, I don't.
Where?
That's terrible.
Oh.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Shut up and deal!
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
What for?
Gas?
Well, you know how it is  things pile up.
That's right, Baxter.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through  with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key 
So do I  I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed  so you better give the tickets to somebody else 
Oh, you don't have to worry 
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Sir?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house  I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it  because I'm all washed up around here.
You?
I know, Buddy boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule  like a Greyhound bus.
That's right.  We were discussing our department  manpower wise  and promotion wise    and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Oh, I found a key there, all right  only it's the wrong key.
I have a vague idea.
I hate to disappoint you  I mean, many happy returns  but not tonight 
I don't know  I mean  I wasn't here  you see  we had some words earlier  nothing serious, really  what you might call a lovers' quarrel 
I don't know what you did to that girl in there  and don't tell me  but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
A mansch  a human being! So you got off easy this time  so you were lucky 
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter  because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No.
Might as well go to mine  everybody else does.
She may be a girl  but she's no friend of mine.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time  preliminary wise.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle  four years ago when we were having a little ring a ding  ding.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing  and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability  and just before you there was Miss What's Her Name, on the twenty  fifth floor 
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff  please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff  we had two wonderful months this summer  and that was it. Happens all the time  the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist  or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over  goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl   They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
We talked about a lot of things.
They got it an a long playing record now   Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me  We haven't gotten along for years  You're the best thing that ever happened to me 
Are you sure that's what you want?
I love you  remember?
I was never very good at history. Let me see  there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi  no, she came before  it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen 
Atlantic City?
The nerve.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles  cookie wise.
I'd spell it out for you  only I can't spell.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now  rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Lovely. You were a big help.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Dreadful.
Wait  wait  don't get up tight  what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that 
Esprit de corps 
One for all  all for one 
Get out 
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too 
Part.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Let's talk about you.
Tracks ?
Then went too far  he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese  Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock  Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
No, sir  I'm a real chef, sir  I'm a sauciere 
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib  magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it  boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
I know.
I'll go with you in a while  judt hold tight awhile 
Where ?
I'll go with him 
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
I am  I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips  it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food  we can pay you in gold.
What is it?
One that went up for murder  he was an Army Sergeant.
Yeah  he really dug his Playboy mag, man  I mean like he was there when it arrived  He just knew.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Anyone got a cigarette.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this  even rumours leaked out.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Of course. I  Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
We endure, captain  you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar  destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing  clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class  L. Johnson, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Boss left.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel  they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Yeah  Na Trang told me to expect you  we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Mercenaries  agents, traitors  they put out caches.
I met him.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
No  no, sir.
Yes.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad  a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
Fuck no.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You knew him best.
Both of us...
What is this bridge?
You're Australian?
And shut up.
The river is beautiful.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores  a case of grenades, a mortar and two M 16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon  some boss stuff 
Stepped on a booby trap, sir  got blown all to hell 
You can pack out of here  two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
89   CONTINUED:
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
157  CONTINUED:
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
26   CONTINUED:  
Six months.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
She's dead.
The radio's on the fritz.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
I'll tell you everything later.
 Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit down.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that  more 
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Nothing personal.
Sure.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me 
Corbett ruined my two way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
Fuck you.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to  more 
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait and switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
We were just talking about him.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom  I hate this. He's a freak show  the worst person I ever met.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Yes.
Emergency room only.
No.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help  judgement call.
It's okay  I'll sit here.
Carol the waitress?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
A thank you note for what you did for me.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
I want you to go on this trip.
What's that got to do with it?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask  I'm not certain.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
You promised a nice place  can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Yeah... Well...
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Okay.
You know what? I...
Yes. I really would.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I just love her.  How're you doing?
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
He's a pain in the ass.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Wait here.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Well, I can't reach them.
Ask him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
Maybe this can wait.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Thanks.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Another place where?
Just a second  he has to go.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Where?
What restaurant?
So you're from around here?
What is this?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Tachlinkov.
We go around once.
Oh, yeah.
Bain!
You're too late.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you 
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Turn off the engine.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
Yes.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why not?
Ahhhh...
Are they usually like that?
After that?
That's fiction.
Why not?
Yes.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
That means you won't have a gun.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't 
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except 
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I didn't notice them.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had 
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Why?
And you were drilling these holes...?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
It can be.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Yes.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Sometimes.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
All the time.
Do you believe that?
Sure.
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
You mean quit?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
No.
That's correct.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
Like you?
And not even then sometimes.
What's that? Free!
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre   they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
He was an electrician?
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine   you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
No, for the Asylum.
Am I late?
No, the boyfriend.
Holly!
It just happened.
What are you on about?
What?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
That bad?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Here!
I'm not hungry, really.
No, by road?
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Regards to Her Majesty.
I'll take a rain check for now.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
What? You are crazy!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Fernet and tonic.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Don't worry. Thanks.
How?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Well she sure isn't normal.
We don't need you.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Yeah seems okay.
Sure!
Hmm, I still owe him.
It's Josh's.
It was the biggest I could find.
A kind of freedom.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Not all of them!
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
You may use my office.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Go to hell!
You bastard!
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Very well.
Heart be still.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I didn't know either.
I need to whizz.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
 Obviously.
Were?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know  ?
'They won't.'
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Looking for something  someone.
Don't you?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
Yes. And?
Yeah 
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind 
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend 
What?
I wanted this to be a date.
Where?
Loved?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Me.
Pull over.
Anything you want.
I used to like yogurt.
That I want you to take me home.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
No.
Dad 
I don't want to see her hurt.
How  how long does she have?
Praying.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
Uh, yes, sir...
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Uh, hi....
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Uh  yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Operator, what's today's date?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X rayed recently, Martin?
Shhhhhhhh!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house  we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Is Shemp all right?
Marty.
We don't....
What if you lost your keys?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Professor, be serious, would you?
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Jesus!
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
I run this place! 
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Mmmmm.
Sure.
What'd you come out here for?
Is that right?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
It's okay.
There you go.
Yeah.
You said that once already... Too late now.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How's he doing?
Excuse me.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I just don't want to go.
Yes.
Stay as long as you like.
Just thinking.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Vanished. Thin air.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
The door's locked.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Which?  The one in my throat.
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings I've got mixed emotions I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
How about you? Will you be alright?
...I know this must look... funny.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Really?...
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
Hah!
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
And what would that be, son?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Well not much.
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write 
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
No, what did it say?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game  door to door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Hell, I could tell you some stories
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
...Yeah, okay.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started  I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me  my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
You gotta believe me 
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you  well I do. Now don't argue with me.
I'm at the Earle.
...Both maybe?
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which he's now missin'.
Anyway.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
What are you gonna do  charge me with smoking?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you  maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
Why didn't you tell me?
Nilsen.
What was she like in school?
Tell me about Catherine.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
About a year and a half.
Yes.
Are you arresting me?
Only when they make interesting reading.
It won't last.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Why not?
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Don't get too cocky.
What if I call you Nicky?
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I don't have a choice.
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I never have before.
Try me.
I found Lisa Henderson.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
It won't sell.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
He was murdered.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
The usual  a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids  nice husband, wasn't porkin' around  no financial problems.  One day  outta the clear blue sky  she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement  I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold plate Seiko watch.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
We bring her in for questioning.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you  a book critic?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy  I'll take the responsibility.
Are you vice?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her  friend.
No. Should I have?
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Oh, I didn't know that.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Yeah, I met her already.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
I don't like beer.
How do you know?
Sure, ok..
I need a dealer.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Who said that?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Really?
Use your fucking instinct.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter racial babies with me.
So then what?
I guess it was a long time ago.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
It's Monday morning.
I hadn't thought about it.
You mean babies with you?
You're your own baby.
Hi.
A present I picked up for you.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
What's that about?
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
Me? Why?
You like your dad's paintings?
Thanks
Have a Mac.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I just don't think you're being fair.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
You'll never guess.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Treat to be here.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait 
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Weird, huh?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So 
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
He is Batman, you moron.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly not.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah  Oswald, please.
And exactly why am I gonna help you?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
And who ... would you say this to?
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down 
Alfred, I know you're sick  I can get you the best doctors.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
What seems to be the problem?
Keep it.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Definitely.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
She knows who we are.
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
I see you knew him.
Can I get some help over here?
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
What?
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
I knew you could handle it.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Adam and Evil.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Then you never loved me?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
What did you say?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Just checking, young sir.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two Face.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Wait. You can't go.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
What?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account 
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
And when you finally get Two Face?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Please. I swear I won't say noth 
You _are_ Two Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi  zonal, bi coastal needs...
Let's see if you bleed green.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Here. Get a good seat.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
He won't kill her.  GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
... Where are you taking me?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago.  I was a solitary child.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
What is it you want?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to  !
No one would miss me.
What are you talking about?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Because I want someone I can trust.
A girl could get killed     so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Our next D.A.  I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that  And he let me keep.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though , Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
I said I'd check with you.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God awful.  Why do you wear it?
No, I'm fine.
Night.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Ahm.....
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Well, Ahm....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room   so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, isn't he.
Great news.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as Vice President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Certainly is.
Richard Burton was very good looking.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
That's one   way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
No it wasn't!
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big screen TV! Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first!
Cut it out butt hole!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Butt dumpling...
Uh... butt snatch...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass goblin...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Ah, the witness?
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Where are his pants?
Yoo hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo hoo!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
You left me.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
She's got photos, Barbara.
Of course I did.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel really confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves  tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Bio busting.  I loves bio busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family  right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Hey you've been on Saturn!  I hate those sandworms!  Yecchhh! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
About what?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
And live in what, our station wagon?
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
They're dead.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I... I don't know what your name is.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then you'll be free.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be filled with people like us.
Stepmother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but 
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I cannot believe this.
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're not here!
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I saw some ghosts.
Viridian?
I know!  We just have to pray that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Attic space.
Probably the world's largest Reader's Digest collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.
Oh, fine.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I will.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's   haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
We have common foes, Chauncey   kid lawyers and our physician!
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Thank you.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
I agree.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Yes.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Hello, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
I see.
Yes. That could be true.
Thank you.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Ben is very ill.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
What'd I tell you? Kid lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
I understand.
Yes. That is correct.
I understand.
A flower...
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
No.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
I agree.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Good evening, Louise.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance   that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
I am a very serious gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas   I understand.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I live here.
No, I do not have any of those.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Very well, Mr. Chance   if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Try again.
I may be a shut in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh, no, sweetheart   it's not you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... It's very bizarre   I don't know what to think...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch   she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No problem, Chief.
Right, Chief.
Right, Chief.
Well, sir   it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President   we'll come up with the answer.
Thank you, Colonel.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Overall   pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
What?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
I am a trained performer.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How dreary   to be   Somebody / How public   like a Frog / To tell one's name   the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
My tits?
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
I'll protect you, Dollface.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Ha ha ha!
Can I be anyone I want?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Do you?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Why not? I need to get in there!
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I love you, Lotte.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Derek Mantini!
What want ye, girl child?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you   I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Thank you.
I will.
May I come in?
Oh.
Ya think?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Morning, ma'am.
Oh I been out.
Better ask Paul D.
I don't know him that well.
I run him off.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
That's so.
Just me.
Never found out.
I don't believe that. I won't.
What yard? When who 
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Yeah. Look bad?
She was my best thing.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Fuck you.
Nothing.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how
I'm going home, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas
They were Nazis, Dude?
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Far out.
I see.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings
...Also, my rug was stolen.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Thank you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some peopleit is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in womenwho engage in it compulsively and without joy.
He fixes the cable?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Now I got
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Oh?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
What if it's during a game?
Huh?
It's your roll.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
But Walter
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me
Now Dude
Huh?
No, I'm
The In and Out Burger is on Camrose.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Yeah?
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
Hey, cool it Walter.
Come on, Walter!.
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
A world of pain.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Minutes.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Like cancer with a purpose.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Sounds like a plan.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
I'll show you.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Blood...
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Ultra rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold turkey in one night.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Two so far.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three hundred horsepower.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Just do it, old man.
Wait.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Frost!!!
I'm sorry, I 
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
He didn't. Get over it.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm not leaving without you.
You're a week early.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
No problem.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite 
Some of the old wives' tales are true  they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock 
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Closer.
my God, Nick???
Yes.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
So whoever built this
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any
It's like traveling back in time.
whatever; that's her.
What is this?
I want to see the tapes.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left
Get your goddamn
Cotter's
you should get back into bed.
fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
You have to go.
Both. Now.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
No.
Butt ugly owl.
I got the tape enhancedand I managed to sleaze a photo blow up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
Domini!
No one ever comes here.
a Wiccan
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
All I need
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
No. I don't think so.
and we brought it back with us!
It touched me, don't you see it now?
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
a lot.
it's not a could'vethere was, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here with us in this place now. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our brains.
That feels good. Lowerdown into my neck.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
You're needed herekeep watching
I thought all witches were benign and good.
the Sheriff's Office
his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!
What happened to my Dad??
I am?
Yeah.
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
I just gotta see a guy.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
I couldn't believe it either...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Abby
I said you're bad.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
In the trunk.
I think someone's watching.
Remy.
I own the place.
Ever durned one.
...Friday?
See, I never knew that.
I don't know. Motel... Abby
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
For the money.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Of course.
How would I know?
You said the usual
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
What's that?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes I have   so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes sir.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
If you want to.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Yeah.
Jeffrey nothing.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Who's it, you mean.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Hello.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
I did. are you?
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
Don?. Where is he?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Yes.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's too bad.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Maybe so.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. he moved away.
Yeah. Good bye.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey!!
What is it?
Where to?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Frank!!
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead.
Go ahead!
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
uh uh.
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah. okay.
You can change it if you want to.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Where do you guys want to count?
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Derek!
What is?
You'll see for yourself.
Are you kidding?
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
It's your grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Twenty six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because I got caught.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Try the closet.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick up.
What?
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Coke.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Oh, I see.
Actually, it was three.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Power?
Yeah, well...
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Tough spot.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
That was a beautiful message.
What about him?
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Are we gonna split up?
Yeah.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Yes, I am.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
And you believe the NLF?
And here?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Second district ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
I'll explain.
Then don't complain.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good evening, sir.
A name?
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes  those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Counsel approach the bench.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity  and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two  fifteen to twenty five.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
That's correct  but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Yes.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What did she say?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself  but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is  how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly  but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going  faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Yes  Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No further questions.
No.
We dated for about a month last year.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
No.
I was at the house one morning  I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You didn't know about it before that?
Sorry.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Sure.  Where to?
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti  living in a hut and becoming a beach bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that  but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive     so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets  leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
It's okay.
It won't be that hard.
No  I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I went out on the boat.
Are you scared?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I love you too, Dad.
 But it's Sunday.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
I am relaxing.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Yes.
I'll talk to him later.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
You used to like to touch me  to make love to me.
It was a place to start.
Daddy  stop it!
No  never.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
Aw, Betty.
No. You can have them.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Come here a minute.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
You mean  she didn't like sex?
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage  
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Clean?
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
The light was fading. Huh huh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Yes, that'd be nice.
No. I can't. Not yet.
How about Bari?
Why?
Near the church.
What?
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
No one's asking you to!
What about us? What about me?
But now that you have it  
Yes. And I've accepted.
Nah.
What's her name?
They're not going to find her!
Cremated?!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
He yours, sir?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Wh wh whooo?
What it will be.
Just try it.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
What?
Hush, baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill!  Bill?!
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Shit, that was fast.
But 
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here  the dance floor.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
That building?
Evidence of what?
What we have to do is call the police.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy six.
All right!  Where's the key?
The same way you did before.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat fuck son!
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
There's no time.
What are you, drunk?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late 
Don't tell him 
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think 
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldn't.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Shut up!
I'm listening.
Yes, I understand.
Sure, Gino, sure.
No.
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, that's it.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
All right.
...  thank you.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
...  yes.
I'm already in your bed.
Nothing.
Shit, here we go.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Do you think you know me like that?
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Not Caesar.
What happened?
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I'm here, aren't I?
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
 if we can get a clean shot 
What do you want to do?
So it's time to go home.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
MPG Capital.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Really.
Excuse me?
Get me out of here.  Please.
I won't hurt you.
Then I'll find another ride.
I was shot twice in the back.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty foot wall  I went out the window and I was doing it  I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I can't believe I slept.
Thanks for the ride.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
 he's got my picture!  this is yesterday!  this is me!    where did you get my picture? 
Marie  look at me  there's no time for this 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
Think I could rent a scooter?
Enhance it.
 yes, sir, it's confirmed 
How did I get here?
I don't know.
I won't forget this.
Uh   what?   I ...
Thank you.
Machines don't fix themselves.
Got there!
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax payers. People want value for money and a cost effective service.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer   am I too late?
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Even later.
Really?   God, how time flies!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Not much.
So how ...?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
If you say so.
Ah.
Oh, sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Suit me?
Well, all wars do  
Every day?
You're joking.
"And your children all gone."
Are you still following me?
Go away.
Don't do anything silly.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
It's not our mistake!
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Next of kin!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Here.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry but ...
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
This isn't rare!
Mother!
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Yes he is   he wants to talk to you.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
I ... uh ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Thank you for calling Cen  
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No, sir.
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Emergency procedures.
What is it?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe   read this, fill in that, hand in the other   listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure   go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
Time to go.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
No ...
Pregnant.
He looks like a cop.
Mary said you might be coming.
Mary, we really have to go.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
You're going to live.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
What's his name?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man, Bucky.
I know him. That's Noel.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
She should go home.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
No, no.
Frank.
The ghosts
Make a left here. I want to stop.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Thanks.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
That's too many.
It's coming.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Look out!
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I've taken that into consideration.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Frank!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You sure?
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Oh, God, no!
Why?  What did they do to you?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Yes.
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Eleven and a half.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Thanks.  The F 14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you  me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
I lost six pounds...
I'm not kidding.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad  it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane  sweat running down my face  makeup falling into my eyes  people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me  all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
This isn't friendship.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too  he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect  the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Well  my wife got this new job...
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
It's been a while since you read the news  I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Right there, Bobbie.
Bobbie, please.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and  you're not, are you?
One's enough.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
That's okay.
Okay.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy  I've got to go to work.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Yes, sure.
Uh huh.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I just got back  I don't know which end is up.
Yes.
Billion.
Excited.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Says who?  Not important  ha ha ha. I was dreaming  Oh, no  can't tell  how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
It moved me.  I did relate to it  I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up  and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Uh uh.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Okay, great, Grunick  Easy shots now  huh?  Good night.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
You want to come?
Go ahead  what?
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
I'm sorry.
Oh yeah?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Shh!
Oh it's enough...
What!
Anything new?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Righto.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It wasn't easy.
Oh...
Here here...
Yes Walter.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I didn't buy it I made it.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
I didn't mean to.
I don't have another cat!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
You want me to open a window or something?
N no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Well, w what did you do?
You're like an undercover guy!
C connection?
Yeah yeah yeah   look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back  
Walter shut up and relax!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Here here!
Why not?
T turned on?
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
What's the matter with you!
Not as single minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Let's move out!
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Amazing!
Get away from here.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Hi, guys.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
So I noticed.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
No...
I am so sure.
Water.  Okay.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I know.
For the dance.
I should have known.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Like my homework.
Why don't we see a movie?
Wait!
Yes.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
She 
All right.
I have cheerleading squad.
Do you know what a Vampire King is?
We'll cover it later.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Don't start with me again.
I...
Not if you're careful.
I can't work this.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You got a C plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Cassandra's really smart.
Nicole...
Really?
I don't understand.
I'm just a girl.
Could be.
Could be.
Okay, what else?
But 
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Throw it out.
Okay.
Buffy?
Nee sitch.  No way.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this 
Okay.
Right!
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
What?
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
A little better.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
No, no, it was great.
I know what it is.
I did.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
You don't have to...
That's great!
I think I'm ready for the Show.
That's my job too.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
You got me all confused.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Yeah...you a witch?
What?
He'll learn.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You spit on me!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Gimme that.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the gameand that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You been in the Majors?
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
Go for it.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
Fear and ignorance.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him 
Pussy.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
See ya at the yard, Meat.
We're getting married.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twicealso league records  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Even if it's the Carolina League this is a chance to play everyday.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother in law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
You were never my guest?!
He's lying.
Yes, you were.
Philip, if you would rise.
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a pity in this...
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't   I  
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Well...
I don't know.
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
Yeah, he had a fool proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know   juice to the fuckin' dealers.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Between...
Why, somebody's complaining?
Nope, there's no way.
In so many words, yes.
Hey, Rich.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Yeah?
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
No, a...
Yeah, I said I   let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
What are you  
And what'd she want?
Sammy.
It's me.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah, she's here.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
All right, we're clear.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Ace, listen to me.
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can't get rid of him?
Who's this?
Okay. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah, I know all that.
I   I   I...
No, I   I... mean...  that can grow as I   as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's   it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Okay.
It's nice isn't it?
But as much as they loved her...
Yeah.
No, he didn't.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I don't need one.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Pretty serious.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Get out of here!
And where'd you go?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wouldn't do that...
Get the fu   You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
So, you're a righty?
Get out of here.
I didn't give 'em the m 
Thanks, Nick.
You shut up.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Hi. Good.
You can't talk to me like...
I understand.
That's not a problem, that's not a p 
...fuckin' jerk off.
Yeah. Fuck him.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine's gone.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I'll tell him, Remo.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
You're so nice. 
Nothin'.
Yeah?
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
All right. Be careful.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
What's the matter?
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
No, Lester.
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester   he called you here.
That's   Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's  
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
Are they out now?
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Boy, look at this place, huh?
All right.
Two.
You know why, right?
'Cause you're a jag off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Get up.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
Pleasure.
It's up to you.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w  You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
What did you think?
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
We'll hunt him down together...
I lied.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who isThe Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed and breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
What did you say?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
I got her...
Absolutely.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
I know.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W 2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Men, huh?
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
"Pre bicentennial babe?"
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrongthis Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Not too cool...
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
You going to talk all day?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Taking messages.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
I didn't hurt you.
Theo wants to talk again.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Or relieve me of it later.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. OUT!
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
I improved on the fucking original.
Sure  and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You don't understand.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
They just walked out.  The smaller man  he must be Dominican or Haitian  he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now  real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now  and I can't stop them.
Let me call the school  tell them not to let her go.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
That makes two of us.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
She's gone 
I'm trying to.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Even if you found us  what then?
I'm not supposed to  but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
But I guess we haven't really met  have we?
When they first started questioning Jack  he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
You're all three of you in that van?
Put the man back on.
Why can't it be her?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
A typical fuck up.
Inform him the fee is seventy five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Ask them.
The money, Nels ... ?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
The cop in the trunk  he could still be alive.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Only one way to find out.
That's not good enough.
You won't live to see it.
Toss them  one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
There are no guarantees in this life.
Some loyalty.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
My pleasure 
You pull up  collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again  you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Put the girl on.
The fuck I will!
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Take the 405 south.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Only you don't have a flat.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Hi, Jimmy.
I would expect he does.
Hi.
Charming.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
Bloody right I do...
Scottish?
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
You can't leave me then, can you?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes...
Like you're concerned.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Depends what it is.
I have to talk to her, Col 
You mean that?
That's a start.
Ask to meet me again.
Know what, honey?
Absolutely.
Don't be cruel.
Okay.
Kind of.
I'm not sure.
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere 
Yes.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Only in times of extreme stress.
You knew which man?
I suppose I tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let me go, Dil
Love you, Dil.
Anything.
It's my name, Dil 
I asked you a question, honey  were you there too 
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
Don't call me that 
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
My pleasure.
Suits you.
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what if you don't?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
I understand.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Good. So what do you think?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
So I've noticed.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
How different?
Shut up, would you?
Having a pint in the Rock.
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me 
How can I?
Stop that talk now 
You don't know me, do you?
You didn't?
People. They could be looking.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
I love you, Adam.
Can you remember anything at all?
It's Thursday today  and it's almost five  come on!
Five o'clock  Thursday  the Garden  it's got to be something around here.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit 
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew  if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace  all that cash?
But 
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him  so whoever killed him has it  they have it!
Agents.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert  that's Carson.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert  be careful.
Next, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Okay  up there.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle  where is it?
I'll take that.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it  Tex, Gideon and Scobie  and your husband  because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie  please believe that.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious  and I especially don't want you to be.
Who?
I'm sorry.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Shut the door!
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie  and the one who's going to be next  me?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it  that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle  Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
How much is it worth?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix  are they for sale now?
And if it is?
Meaning what?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
