Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
do you listen to this crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
She okay?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going   and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Is that woman a complete fruit loop or is it just me?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You the new guy?
How many people were in your old school?
That I'm used to.
He always have that shit eating grin?
What makes you think he'll do it?
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Assail your ears for one night.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Where ya goin?
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Who's that?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Pick you up Friday, then
Why 're you doing this?
Why?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there  
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
Why can't we agree on this?
As a parent, that's my right
Bianca did what?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic   so why is it that you're such a fuck up?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What does he say?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I am listening, my son.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I believed in you...
New worlds create new people.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Do they have such thoughts?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Are you married?
The men are out of quarters   practicing putting out fires.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I'll make some for us.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Who's there?
Tall, short haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Hmmmm.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Leon   meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Why not?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you   I didn't touch her.
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Okay.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant   we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by   ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar   for a bad habit   I would've had my head blown off.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Ready?
Are you married?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film   I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
In here, says he wants a million.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Get in the bathroom!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
New York.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
SPACE STATTION 5   LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Okay. 
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy two hours.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes, it does. The sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
That's true
Name?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
You lying son of a bitch...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Well?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
There.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
No class...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
What about Luther?
We missed.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Yeah, I see her.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Hey, there she is...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Yeah...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Bullshit red tape.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Hey, you're right.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Hey, I don't believe it.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Three more hours...
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Let her go.
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
What're you laughing about?
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
They all like this in your family, father?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Hello?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
...Shit!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good bye", that's all I need.
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...Like love...
Tell me...
The cash man!
It's not?
This is all that survived?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Wait or act.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Anything harder?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You said something about money.
Excellent.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Alright, Tom.
I figured you share information.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Celebrity Films.
Yeah, who's this?
What?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Not quite.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
You're learning.
Wha... ?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
Nothing remotely like this.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Hello... ?
Do you know what happened to her?
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
We'll figure it out.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17 year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What is it?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Is that who you're waiting for?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Where is he?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
Where are we going?
How was the meeting?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him   pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
It's okay.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage,  Commander !  It just so happens I'm  not  a coward   physical or mental   and before I'd risk my father's life...
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating    What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself  
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and  
Skipper   could you take a look here...?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM   so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all   what if it's  magnetic ?
All ready?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
It is a living thing.  When damaged   you would say 'wounded'   it immediately 'heals' itself.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Double A. New Britain.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Where'd you get the blood?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus, why?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
On what you pay me?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids  
We should talk.
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed   I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Oh, Wade.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause   has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
What about Margie?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset   one thing on top of another.
To help, Jack, of course   and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
I don't drink coffee.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Uh, we got a problem here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
It was a good ad lib, sir.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Why?
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this   when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Stop.
The fax machines.
One.
Yeah, right.
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted   very, very, very sick.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
That's not possible.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world  renowned agronomist?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Captain, how soon can we land?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Fourteen B. It's halfway down on your right.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
The guys at the mini mart last night made a half assed stab at the money in the till   but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Who is he?
Your health...
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
How potent?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car 
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Okay, let's do it.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame units only.  I want rifles slung.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'll go.
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That the atmosphere processor?
You son of a bitch.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state of the art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
It's game time.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Thanks.
We need the other drop ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Fifteen meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Burke!  Open the door!
I knew you'd come.
Can we dream?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
What's that?
What?
Oh   excuse me!
No, she's fine.
No! I won't have him back.
Why what, sir?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra I'm sick. Sick   kiss I'm   my Kiss my! Sra I'm sick   Kiss my arse!
No!
Iram   marry Em   marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
I don't know.
What?
You're not going to do this?
Why not?
Frau Mozart?
These are originals?
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Why you?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's adorable!
Hey!
A flat, Majesty.
My pleasure.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, what about him?
Do you always live like this?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
That's right.
Yes.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
I'm sorry. No.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Do you have a daughter?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right   I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Why bother with Orsini Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
With all my heart, Mozart.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How long will you give me?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
What?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure   C.  Con fu ta tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma le dic tis.  All right?
Do you have me?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
So?
Where?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
No, you didn't!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
He's setting that play to music?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
That lady is back, sir.
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Surely you're not suggesting...
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Shall I send a car?
What do you dream about?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
The bedroom.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
But, David.
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
All right, you two, move along.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
You're in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
There were witnesses?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
You're not having a good time are you?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
What about it?
What the hell was that all about?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
It's you, David.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
You're not real.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Because this must be stopped.
What's that?
Oh.
I don't rightly know, sir.
No kidding?
Where's Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise crack for this one . . .
About twenty four thousand.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Where you been?
And listen, wise guy   I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
What good will that do?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Thanks.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
What do you mean?
Dude   there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Why are you so anxious?
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes, of course.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson   they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union Leeds   the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You haven't got a uniform?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Yes, sir.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, sir.
How do you do, Mrs. Dickson.
What did you do with it?
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
In Cluett's office?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
What did you find out, Mike?
Dude Finlay?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
I ain't done  
"The outlaws calling themselves the James Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Thanks for the help.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
The James Younger Gang.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
A bad idea.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought  
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
What the  
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think  
Another dozen out back.
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
"Big and older"?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Ma! Please!
Teasing you is completely unfair.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Little ones.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
I don't understand.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Don't turn around.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
That's what I would have done.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Really?
Thank you, Miss   ?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Really!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Just perfect.
Parker.
What is that?
That.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
You like it there, don't you?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Why? What's wrong?
But what about the past? Our past?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Listen, what about dinner?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Late?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
I'll do it.
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Who?
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Interesting.
Jean? What?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Patrick? Is that you?
Just...say...no!
A model? An actor?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Coffee?
KIMBALL.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Would you rather I not smoke?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
He had a yacht?
Don't you know this?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
No, I like music. Just they're Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
He does? You're sure?
Listen, what's your name?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Hey, Halberstam?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start up with Teddy and me.
I'm just screwed.
It's important.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating  
What!
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
That was   different.
Milo?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?
What?!
Is it your software?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
We could move 'em up here.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
You've been coming in early.
You could've handwritten it.
Gary, I  
This is good. Who did it?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Ready for number three?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and  
...You wanna work   here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Every entry was authorized.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
What've you got there?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
That's great. I   didn't know.
...Milo?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
It's how on line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know  
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Please don't go.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...You got my E mail?
Is that how Larry feels?
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
That kid's the great white hope.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Thank you.
Yes?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Carnies.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish made penis enlarger pump.
One warranty card for Swedish made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
Oh my God, he's back.
Shut up.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Right.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
You didn't...
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige  
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Knight ...
Nature ...
Hope...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
May I help you, madam ...
Your voice   it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Close. We're so hush hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's  
Who?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Much better.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere   Julie.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Not quite. This is my field.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Steed ... !
Was I?
And do you trust me?
You're playing games.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea  '
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Where's Mother?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Privately owned by ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
John Steed.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
And...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
That feels so great.
Well... twenty four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party goers   there are professionals in this crowd   I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Great bathing suit.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you   Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
What can I be doing for you?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You want to share it?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
I'd love that.
Where'd she go?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
What's this?
You're late again, Rick.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Oh these moments do try me...
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
  What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
I like what you've done with the place.
In the Field Museum once.
People actually used to pay you for this?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Thanks.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
  Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's  
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people  
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak  
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
  Shhh.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Read.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Did you pull me out?
Did I say thanks?
Four months?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Completely out of control.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Firehouse.
Dad!
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Yeah? When was the last time?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Who's this?
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
People.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
I forgive you.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids  
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
You don't have the demographics.
We're ready when you are.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Please, have a seat.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
So that's what you been doing?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
You're now Mantan.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
...exactly thirty two minutes ago.
Four minutes ago.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz hook!
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
That's what I'm askin'.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So what's up with you?
Sounds risky to me.
You okay?
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
Is that good or bad?
How so?
Why'd you do that?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Hi, Mona.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
You feel good, not nervous?
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Yes you!
You sing and dance?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money and nothing else?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so called bible  thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball dunking, football running, hop hip rapping ebonic speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Around...
...then what about...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin' on.
What else?
Oh you do, huh?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
What?
And?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
It is shameful   infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
For whom else have you worked?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Never.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
I feel the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because   because   the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
May I be quite frank with you?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are   if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on  
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Some.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then  
You shot Childs and Nunez.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
Cadet, what's your name!
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Roberto, what the fuck?
Right?
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him  
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Full clip to the body  
I... I don't know...
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick up.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him  
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it  
Ah, Christ
Is Dunbar cute?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend  
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave  
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy   that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong  
Why do you care?
I didn't shoot West...
What?
That's a fantastic idea  
I pushed him too hard.
For what?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Hardy, what are you doing  
We need to talk  
This isn't the time  
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half  
We just want  
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail  
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Tell him to shut up  
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
So?
But this guy you called, he's not even Army  
You want Kendall, don't you?
Great, great. That's fantastic.
See! The big guy likes it.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
You won't find a better place!
Well, she... uh...
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You don't like it?
Okay.
What did she say?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Dad!
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
Let's get out of here.
I don't believe it!
This is it? The whole vault.
Are you Jenny Hill?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Mom?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you like it?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Yes. I know.
And...
Right.
What was that?
You must have a visa or something...
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
What was that?
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants a lot of money.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I don't hate you.
Sometimes which?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Have you had any before?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Whatever.
Why?
My name's Sophia.
What are you doing?
Lazarus?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Hey.
What do you need?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Still need a lift?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Uh uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
YOU SHUT UP!
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I don't want you to let go.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Keep the change on that.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
What?
I feel better. Do you?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
What's this?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are they doing now?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
What'd you say?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
Know her?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick san.'
Nick...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus san, not Nick san. Nick.
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
Nick, you can't do this.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I don't remember saying yes.
Might be different in New York.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
I want a gun.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
You had my help, detective.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
And what can he do for you?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies   like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
But not to last.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
He could?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Six, huh?
You got a machine on it yet?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel  mill.  I don't mind a bum steer once in a while   it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You start.
How do I stop one?
Not if it works.
Next.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Vodka!
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Let's hear it.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
During the road test...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Yeah?
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
The best.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In a magazine you come across a full page photo of a nude girl.
Who is this?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Uh huh.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
Bad?
May I ask a personal question?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself   who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
I'm hungry, J.F.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Get out of here!
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Wait!  Wait!
It's Perry!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
What's fair?
Why not buy them milk or something  instead of Dr. Pepper?
Who are these people?
Thank you.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Then forget it.
Because I want to get married.
It does?
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
Get out!
He has a computer?
The guy with the underpants!
Yep.  You know, my father   who is a scientist   says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
No!  Not crazy!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
What?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most 
I'm leaving, too.
Eve?!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can  
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
I've got to go, now.
These are wonderful.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Helen Thomas Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
But, I don't understand.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus to kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh huh.
You have very nice ceilings.
I've got goose bumps all over me.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
How old are you?
The sky?  Where?
Help you?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Dad!
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
No.
Oh, my God!
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Good god.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Days??
Thirty  five years!
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Hi, honey!
Get the presents and do the lights.
Yes, yes it is!
We stay down here.
Yes.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
How long will you set it for this time?
What are you bitching about now?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un be liev able!
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Go to the bathroom.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Or have perfect table manners.
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I'm going to need two more banana  splits and a cherry coke!
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Jeffrey?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
And that man came out with a third man   this well dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank 
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Dorothy. No!
Yes.
They hurt his head.
Frank gone?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Hey? You like to walk.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Well.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Oh yeah?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Are you alright?
Yes. I do.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
No, silly   I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
Okay.
What was that all about?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Sandy?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Just for him?
Up where?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
You think they sold me out? No way.
Anybody see ya?
They got nothing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
Oh, we're good man.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Now, you will receive us.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Who the...
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
What are you serious?
Hello?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We'll keep going, Roc.
Has he now?
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Don't do this my son.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
What does Starsky say?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Dignan, calm down.
Is that the manager?
What about what that guy said?
You owe me fifty bucks.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
What the fuck is going on here?
She's from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
See, now we've got a plan.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
He's gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just  
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk  
I have an idea for that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
She doesn't need to know.
Our money situation is not good.
Sixteen dollars.
He doesn't want to fight.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the  
What's happening? What's going on?
Where's Kumar?
Come on.
Dignan, it's too late.
How big is it?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
That's a sharp jacket.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
See you.
You think he got my license plates?
Anthony, I  
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Was Future Man adopted?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Yeah.
It's in the driveway.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
I paid for it.
How much is there?
You really think he'll remember you?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Way to go, Bob!
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Bob. Are you coming?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
That could be anybody's.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Come on, Bob.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What's the story?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Treadstone.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...Ivan Mevedev   senior financial manager   worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Sorry to wake you.
Sir...
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
That's not what happened to your parents.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You know I'm not.
Front. Use your teeth.
You still should've moved.
Try again.
You're sure?  We should still   we should write it down.
  it hasn't been two years  
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
It's just a nightmare.
No... How?
But we were so careful.
Where  
Switch! You drive!
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I love you, too.
You hear me? I believed you.
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
So when was I here?
That's a lie!
We need to get in there.
  so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago  
  go   take the van!  
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
  who?   who else is here?  
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Still...
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Amnesia?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Believed what?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Some women like Dobermans  
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
What it means in England   and in Scotland too   is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you, but only one way   if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Longshanks promised!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Keep these. We're going too.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We must run in different directions!
  while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I don't know... I don't remember.
I... I blacked out.
Did Da   Jason    get good grades?
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Get out. Both of you.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
What's happened to you?
Because you're... different.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
I just thought you should know.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I don't get it.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm Master General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
What the hell are you doing?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Lung cancer?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Shut up, Tommy!
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word  
Does he know that?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
You want my advice?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light  
I'd better be going.
You haven't heard my offer.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Rick?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
  It was "La Belle Aurore."
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I didn't count the days.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Put them on the table.
But Richard, no, I, I  
Where is Rick?
This time they really mean to stop me.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Yes?
Ask me?
Ilsa, I  
No, Victor, there isn't.
Good evening.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
But we made a deal.
No, Captain, please.
My bill.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
For the time being.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
I was misinformed.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Oh, no, Rick never  
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Call off your watch dogs you said.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
Will I see you tonight?
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you  
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Are my eyes really brown?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
He'll double what I pay you.
No. Not me, boss.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
It's bad.
No more water, you said.
Get water!
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
It's real.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
No.  that was the last one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Hey, look at you.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
That's your dog.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
When's the next Jumbo?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Need some help?
You're Chuck Noland.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Really?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
When'd you start working here?
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
You're fucking dead!
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
What'd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How many months are you?
Oh...
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
A movie *outside*?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
What's the *medical* explanation?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back  but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I've got some more clothes for you  I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Is *your* father dead?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Did you bite it?
It looks like you bit it it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
What kind of plane are you flying?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Where are you going?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
I'm stayin', Homer.
First pregnancy?
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I don't need this I know all about my condition.
I am not a doctor.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
That just ain't right, Jack your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Then it's malaria?
*What* view?
I told him that you all is sick.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy  you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
So how'd you get caught?
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole type... How HE fleeced.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
You know what we're doing with the money.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You'll be there?
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Minus one.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
That tip not work out for you fellas?
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Sorry, I  
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
That's not  
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Mr. King, I think  
You need to get a haircut.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
Uh... Everything okay?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
He was looking out for you.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...
Stop waving that thing around.
It's bad luck.
Meet me at my place later.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny   Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
King ain't gonna like this.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What happened?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
So what do you want?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin  
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross  departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
You sell it.
I hate cheats.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I get it.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
Are you trying to read my palm?
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
What?
Nothing about you.
Yes, I know that.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Toss you for it.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Which side do you like?
I'm in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino  
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
I want you to forget what I said.
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
Ross.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live, Jack?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Does Bella come here?
What happened to Bella?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How many aces are left?
I make it six.
You want me to check?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Thanks for the information.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
The key!
It didn't go off.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Well of course I exist.
Exactly.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
So if you detonate in...
Pinback...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
TALBY!
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
What's that, sir?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Commander? Are you still there?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Move it.
But I'm afraid of 
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Damn... Are you alright?
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight 
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
So what are you gonna do about it?
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
But she does work here?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Say the words, "I understand."
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Only one I can think of.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all girl team and let mama licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Make the call.
Playing hooky again?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
You left out condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one 
True, but 
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy 
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Thanks, miss.
No, I mean... you love your son?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Oh, Dicky, I c c can't...
No problem.
We've got to take this slow...
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Whoa... she just farted.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Now, how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Dude, this is all I got.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
But, mom!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho bitch from hell.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Oh, everything's hunky dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I did?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space time.
A wormhole with an Einstein Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
When can I squeeze one out?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Wanna walk me home?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's alright... I understand.
They suspended me for two days.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
My mom is gone.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
What?
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
People aren't that simple.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
What else do you think about during school?
What about your family, Donnie?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Regret.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Where are we going, Donald?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Gerald.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
How did this happen?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Wicked.
Where is she?!
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
I'm lucky I have an after school job where I can practice my talent.
Go on! Get out!
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
What're you doin' here?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side saddle if you have to   like a horse. C'mon, now.
Okay?
And the year before that?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah   yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Yah   she's damn near as good as that little black fella   with the glass eye.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number  
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
What!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis  
Hey you!!
Oh, no   nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven   go to lunch at twelve   and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now   where were we? Oh, yes   I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition   you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You no gotta no gun.
That's not fair   we've only got fifty thousand.
So!   He's on your side, too.
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's what you think.
Then it's war?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Well   they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come   say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Gloria   may I call you Gloria?
I   I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said   I suspect the Secretary of War.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Uncle, you can't do this!
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
What is it, Treves?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...!
Alas, no.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Is he... dying then?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyess.
Yes!
Yes.
My... name is...
Merrick...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
How long will I stay here?
Ohhh...
The children! May I see?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Good morning, John.
...my... home?
Yes John?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath time soon. Has he eaten?
Very smart indeed.
Well...
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
It's your fantasy...
It's sinking! Hy Brasil is sinking!
Those things in your hands.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
No!
But you don't realize....
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Really.
I'll tell you what...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Is there something the matter with it?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About NOT raping you...
You told them I raped you   why?
Why should you care?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
I... I... KILLED her...
I want to die...  No, I don't!
SHUT UP!
It's magic.
You must help us.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
You mean we'd be dead?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Row!
I think we should go...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
What are you talking about, Erik?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Bye, Leif.
How did he do that?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea sick, you know.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
What?
Get away, Snorri.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
And something to sharpen them with?
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Yeah.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit   I could see a halo of frizz   you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Yeah, you told me that later.
I'm sorry.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
  because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
You sure? That doesn't sound  
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
You like that?
Well, I should probably get going.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone   that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life   that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tomorrow?
Let me drive you home.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
What?!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
More?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What if you hide me?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Probably.
You know what I did.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
When?
Listen, did you want to make love?
Have sex. Y'know  
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and  
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What took you so long?
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
What? What do you mean?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
How was it?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just   there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary...
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
What, Howard?
Stan? What's going on?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
This book   It's essential that people read it because      It's the truth. And only I know it.
It's an apartment.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very  
What was that?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
What do you believe in then?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals   and plants!   as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
No, I guess not.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
Holy shit...
We have a man down...
We'll have to re route through the port conduit to the APU.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Do you hear it? Right there.
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What does?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
This is Weir.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Can anybody hear me...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
I can see that, what're they for?
Any survivors?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
If it worked.
What about it?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Captain Miller...
Sir.
Thank you.
Now what?
Ion drive will engage in... T minus ten minutes.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Who?
Go ahead.
Miller, come in...
What?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir can't be alive.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
First time in a grav couch?
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
There's no one in the corridor but us.
We have to do something, oh God...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
What are you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self control is an asset.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead  
Where is Reed?
Ben?
Oh my G g g. What did you... do to Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast food, strip mall science  
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
The shields on the station should protect us.
How long was I out?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Reed?... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could  
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Me like y.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
You need to control yourself and think before you  
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full on 24 7 fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
You two need a time out.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys  
They're ready for you, sir.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half  think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but  
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee 
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or  
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm  
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Ben did this?
But I'm not done with the machine  
Victor, your scar  
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job  
Reed's gonna fix me up  
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Something happened to them, mon.
On the ledge?
I take out the garbage.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Oh. Hi.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Mike! You have a mess on C 9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Yo.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Was it great?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Sometime?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
You just ripped my card in two!
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks for picking me up.
Where do you feel like going?
It's very warm out tonight.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Where's Mike today?
John Bonham?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
What do you mean by that?
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
That's good...
Why?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour   but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Jesus.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Lucy.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
No, she's looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Stop!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
What tunnel? Where?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Scared?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
What now, Geronimo?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
How are you holding up?
Oh, no.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
What? Really?
He's dead.
Open?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
I wouldn't do that, son.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Let's move.
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Did we make it?
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich  
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
You're afraid!
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Get your clothes on.
Without me.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Were you a drug addict?
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
I know that, Dad, but  
Are you... are you hungry?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Kurt!
Age?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Why?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
How ya doin', Farmer?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Oh my God, I look awful.
Evening, gorgeous.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
To quarter horses.
There's just one more thing.
You give up on her?
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
Where to?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Pretty morning.
Shit!
...Is that not true?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
I'm not!
'But how do I know you love me?'
You think I got it?
Mama...
What?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Don't... talk crazy.
You're not going anywhere!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am    Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
I don't believe so.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
This whole thing is a joke!
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
And he drove me to mine.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
It can't be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Come warm yourself if you like.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
And if I consent?
This was not taken from a grave.
She's beautiful.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
Are you all right?
What does it say?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
You make me weak.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously guarded secrets.
Professor?
Now you've got him started.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Quite a place.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
I have always loved him.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Ah. An explorer.
Creature? A... human like creature?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Cabin B is ready.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You draw very well.
Next Friday.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
What's the matter with it?
I wouldn't know.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
What hath God wrought?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Yeah. I got it on before this      all started.
What was that?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
What about Kate?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Yes.
How'd she die?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Why not, against your religion?
What are you going to do?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
Did he...?
I promise.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Mexico.
What did I say?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Watch my back!
See ya.
  see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
What dya mean?
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
Richie? You okay?
Do they have an X rated channel?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases  
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
No, sir, WHAT?
Then good night.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization   of the same sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Shit.  Think we're had.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Yes?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F 14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together   though just now I'm gearing up for a child care vote that  
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Really don't wanna be captured, el  tee.  Heard some bad things.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Automatic five second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender norming," O'Neil   standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Just a coincidence?
Chances of recovery?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year   your year.  That sound right?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell and a half.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Nah, they were dead ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there   and could come back any time they wanted.
Do you, uh, know...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why  
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
This ain't workin' right!
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Where's Audrey?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Circuits are overloaded.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Your old sweetheart?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
I can't.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
They didn't make it.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Somebody must have seen it.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Are you looking for this?
We know.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
What's with the chewing gum?
Who the hell are you?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
God, what an ass.
About this much.
Go ahead!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
He wants to THINK!?
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
May I get the check?
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
Hi Brandon.
Oh.  Okay.
... Yes?
How did you come to that conclusion?
What?  Up?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
It's Jason...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Are they behind us?
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Wait. What did you say?
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Theramin.
But what if Sarris survives?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of 
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You  You have saved our people.
"Deception..." "Lies."
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them 
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Find them.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Go on... I want to hear everything.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country   possibly the world   are sitting at this table...
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts   which Congress recognizes   and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
What?  What are you talking about?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Who is that!?
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yessir.
What's your advice, Alexander?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
They are... friends of Congress.
Let's not over do it...
Partially...
A grand scheme?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
You must be very rich.
These supplies...?
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
I say!
What is this?
I reserved a Cadillac.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
You see the paper?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You get the money?
You gave him the money?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
There's Ilona.
You know how to write one of these?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Where's Karen?
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I'm working on a few things.
I don't know.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
What?
Who the fuck are you?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm looking at you.
That's what I'm doing.
I want you to.
Come on, Harry   Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
You don't even know these guys.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Really.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
I miss Murray, Harry.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Lufkin. His... agent.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Fucker!
Damn mind of it's own.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
The turbine blew.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Maybe that is his boat.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How long, then?
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the fuck   ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Morning everybody.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Stay away. Or else.
What?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Who?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
The what?
What happened.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Murphy to Epps.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
It's a Noaa buoy.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
No, no. You got leak.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Will you get off my back for once?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
I was in a horrible mood   tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
I'm so excited to see this film   Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
I I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry   I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Hi... what's up?
What do you mean "why"?
Nothing.
Oh, hi...
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Why?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini malls in the 1950's?
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
Ew, look at this...
Not really...
"Funky"?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Where are we going?
What was that all about?
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
I am not   I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
When was this?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Perhaps the "Jam in ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
Punk rock is over!
Oh, how "punk."
...are you waiting for a bus?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Thanks for the tape   I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
That's five hundred dollars.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Is this one any good?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman"   I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Really? Can I see it?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some  
Wow, this is so cool...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
So, I don't really get it   are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked up situation...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke   you have to call her back!
Well when can we do something?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What's up?
Uh... sure... come in.
That's Dana's   I'm supposed to be saving it for our two month anniversary. You better not  
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana   I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
You've never built in Africa.
Lovely sound  they seem happy.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles    I've brought them.  Is he here?
And it worked?
Let me explain about time  you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead  I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey    but what are you going to do about it?
 then he feasted on him, starting with his feet 
Silliest thing I ever heard of  why in the world should we go through all that?
I tried to be late, John  it would have been easier if you'd gone.
 oh please  if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes    best I stop. One of the by products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
What a good week.
Got me out of trouble.
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
How many do you think they've killed?
The workers don't get on?
For you.
Why do you laugh?  you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Janosz?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine   and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Be careful on that sofa   it's a butt biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So   are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I'm not even good for me.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia  
  the sorrow of Moldavia  
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
I'd like to have a stool specimen
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
So far so good.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
I'm Egon  
Six feet   seven   eight  
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray  
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
What happened?
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
Uh huh.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Who's the stiff?
Can't you tell me now?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
But why?  The students love us!
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte   the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
In the physical sense.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
All right.  What is it?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yes?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Did you see anything?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
I told you it's real.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
How was your date?
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
For the gods, spit it out!
Where have you been?
You must start clearing everything with me   especially your lovers.
Then you'd be out of a job.
I'm ordering a general stand down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty first, you know.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
No future telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
The Senators admire you.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
He's very realistic.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
You need to come home!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'm a soldier   we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
When you get to Ostia, use this   bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Take your hands off me animal!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
You put this inside your shirt   when Tiger stabs your stomach   it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Will you take me home now?
I think I'd better go home now please.
Listen   could you stop crying, please?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Where we going?
Listen, Elaine   it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean   as far as I know.
Benjamin  
What's the matter?
Don't cry. 
Where are you meeting this person?
Yes.
I don't understand  
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
What are you looking for?
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
You won't?
Is that so? You might marry me?
Elaine   are you serious about this?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh no. He said that.
Benjamin?
Well   you see   the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment  
Ben.
Ben   I just want to say one word to you   just one word  
You a student?
Look   I'll give you ten dollars for a dime   I'll give you twenty   for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Give me an hour.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
What do you think of me?
No.
I mean   you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Her portrait?
No.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you  
But they would! Don't you see?
Yes, I do.
May I sit down?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Why don't you get it.
Well   goodbye then  
Well.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
Now   do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Anything. Anything at all.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until  
How do you get out of the house?
We're talking.
Right.
Why did you do that?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you   I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
Really. I want to know.
No.
Well   I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's  
Do you understand that?
What are you doing?
But it's not.
Oh no.  Look   I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Now listen   this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well   when did you decide all this?
Well  
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
Sir?
I know.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Oh say   Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
You miss the point.
Can you see me now?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
It's a short life and a gay one...
And what are you going to do?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Poor girl   chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know   I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty   not young but  
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Like dancing?
Oh!
Reducing?
Yes   yes indeed   but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Shall we say five o'clock   downstairs?
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
Yes   I'd love to.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh   there's no real thing   it doesn't exist.
You live here?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room   and you come... What now?
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone  
Why do you smile?
Flix.   And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'll not denounce you.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go   
You do believe that I really love you?
Can't   can't you   Couldn't you come too   I think it would be better   for us   for us both.
Six twenty seven in the morning... But the money?
I'm worried about you.
Thank you, sir.
Permit me   my name is Kringelein   from Fredersdorf.
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
The Baron is tired?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Is that too much, Baron?
You're all right now   it's very late   goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening   my key   one sixty  eight.
Grusinskaya   well, to tell the truth, Baron   tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well   last night was not so good.
The war.
The stenographer is to go up   Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya   at once  
The night clerk has already gone   you are late.
News? Yes   killing in number one  sixty four.
Anyone asked for me?
Oh   but   I  
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
I'm always alone   I have been everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Dance then? 
Really?
Please   please!
Yes, of course,   money!
Of course I do   I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know    I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing   I'll take care of you. Will   will you let me?
No.
Oh   too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must go to England   at once.
Insolent young cub!
Oh, no.
Oh   ho   you want legal aid against us?   The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water   What a place!
I know you did   I said you did  
Evil days   I've shown you here      my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Sorry, Preysing. 
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
How clear is Manchester?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
I can't dance tonight  
Orchids come again, Madam   no card   I think perhaps they are from the same young man   he is at the end of the corridor   tall   he walks like a soldier   Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance  
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha   hurry, come on. Tonight   there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Suzette   I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back, Suzette.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room   oh   I see, Mr. Preysing   I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
What's the use of asking, Gru   he is at the train   He will be there.
Waiting   I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know   I know.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
You're a thousand percent right!
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Here you are! Two rich people!
Yes, yes, but that's  
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
What? Me?
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I like those.
Sure.
Why?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and  
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but  
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
Nobody does that single o.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
Don't I get any say in this?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
Roy Dillon?
I realize this is a shock.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought iron poker.
Carter.
Mind if we sit down?
Funny, we just drove right in.
Do you know who did this?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
What the  
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
What?  Where is she?
What are you doing here?!
Better?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Hey, you alright?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Ooooh, busted.
You're so easy...
He do that to you?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Seven thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack o' lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine  thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Mommy!!!
What should I do?
God ... this can't be true.
Come on, sweetheart   what is this? Who's coming?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from  
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or  
Halloween.
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through   our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Yes?
No   there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
A bitch.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
No.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Otherwise, how are things?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Go to the funeral?
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Gee whiz 
I wouldn't drop my gun.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura" "the sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band in the war against the Nazis.
You're supposed to get hurt!
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Play?
What's this?
Can I help you, sir?
Eighteen   and a half.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
I'm engaged.
This is crazy.
What's the matter?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Bluh.
Your old beau?
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
That's what you're supposed to say.
It couldn't!
Fish can't feel.
Such as?...
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I came for Paul as well.
Did you like it, dear?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still two hundred years from now.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze a honey colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B 36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone   like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
I mean it!
Help your mother find the bullet.
Hello?  Oh hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh you came back.
None.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty eight feet of cockroach  infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
This is man to man.
You're old so old.
You're a son of a bitch.
Hands and knees, you say?
You hope.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Something seems to have happened to my self respect.
Was I ever of use?
Like the saber toothed tiger.
Can't do it.
Thank you for my life.
Dead!
What happened?
How horrible.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
No.
I know.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I hate that thing.
Is Norbert still here?
Mom?
What are his symptoms?
My father!
Don't worry about it.
He isn't?
Yes?
I'm touched.
Did you see him?
Is he coming home?
The park!
Did you talk to Paul?
What was it?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton wear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
He can make the sound of human footsteps which is a terrifying sound.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Is that a fact?
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
Just one.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you sure it's all right?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
And your wife? Where's she?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
You know what I'm talking about.
Say what?
No.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
It's not quite the same thing.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Why do you say that?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec u lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Andy.
I don't know.
Where is she?
Yeah. Probably.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm only human, you know.
Do the police want to arrest me?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Wes, do me a favor.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
I thought you were a businessman.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What's that?
You can fuck off, too.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Could I see your registration?
But there is a family resemblance.
What do you see?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you sing and dance?
Yearse!
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
A self portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You don't look eighty.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
What is it?
Oh, my. We're too late.
No.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I  think  I see it.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Died! Seventeen times   not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Oh, you weren't scared.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then   and yet how the same.
Farewell?
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty year old pallbearer for a daughter in law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
How do you do?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
No.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for  fun ? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Your classmates?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
How about to slit his throat?
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
He... he loved me.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
O.K. Let's go.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Nonsense, I...
He talked about Demons, huh?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside  
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out  
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
C'mon   Rasputin??
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin  
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Got tired of me?
Sir, may I go first??
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
  should go back. Now!
Helping you   I just  
Myers?
Hey, your chili's getting cold  
Um... Liz   I   there's something I'd like you to   something I need you to hear.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And   that's good. It really is. I   wish I could do something about this    But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
It's freezing, isn't it?
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
Yes, I  
Christ!
It's my lucky day.
What's happening?
The box... you opened it. We came.
Many times.
Just in time.
Please. Get back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
You bastard  
Bastard.
Well can I come in or not?
What about Larry  
Back from where?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
  to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Later.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
So where's the harm?
Maybe we should just leave  
What's the problem?
How long since you were here?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
No argument.
Well?
What have you done?
You're NOT going to faint.
Take it slowly.
You're done worse.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Oh baby.
Well, isn't it?
Is this your place ?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
I suppose not.
Oh Christ.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
What did you say?
Well I want you to see the house.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What are you drinking, love?
I guess.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Get the fuck out of here.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Meaning what?
Oh no?
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Play it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Nice, Barry.
Not the point.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I wanna date a musician...
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
What?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album  
What?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
That's what I said.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna Moss.
What are you talking about?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
What's this?
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob.
Rob  !
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I suppose so.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
You won't like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
So, how are you?
Will you call me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
You're soaking.
What do you mean?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Mission accomplished.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Where?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  Probably not.
So?
About what?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
So you'll stay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
What do you think?
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen hundred?  They're worth five times that.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex wife.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
No.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
 Okay okay.
Jesus Christ.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'd rather hear yours.
What's all that?
You make it all sound so simple.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Who are you?
He is older than I.
Not the same.
What is it like?  Being you?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
A murder.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Requiem acer'nam donaei 
Stop.
Aye.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some  thing were pushing against you?
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Not so scared.
Finish your prayers?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Equals?
You see Major?  You are not so different...
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
_Answer_ me.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How are you?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
And have you something to settle with me?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
We have some unfinished business.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
Did you know the victim?
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you know what this is?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Home.
The resemblance is amazing.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Who is it?
Ain't you got any more sense than to   ?  Oh, h hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Remember the ending?  "   and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white haired mother's tears..."
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
All right.  One   two   three   four   five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch   didn't Hildy tell you?
Anything the matter?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Call Duffy!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What do you want?
No   Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure you can. Come on.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll faced mugg  
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you   and the paper needs both of us.
The quicker the better. Well   I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
You said it.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this   but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train   and thanks just the same.
Now you're talking!
What tricks would I pull?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Walter! D did you see      that?
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you   Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you   the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Railroad tickets.
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Oh, for    H. Sebastian   Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It   it wouldn't be cricket!
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it   unless you want to write this story yourself.
Then why are you doing it?
Where'd you wire him?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to   how about Niagara Falls?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
But, Hildy   I can explain  
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
I don't know  
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Hold the phone!
We know what you're up to.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
What went off?
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Shoot to kill, I said.
And so do I!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Any news?
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Look out, you  
Have you got my dough?
Here!
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
Mother!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's the idea?
Hey  
What's from the Governor?
Who? Me?
But how do I know...?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife  
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
What's your hurry?
Baldwin   his name is.
The door was locked.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Give him the you know what.
It's true.
Pauline's mum got killed.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
You wouldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
You're the biggest fibber.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
You said that last year, Dad.
Who pays for them?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air raid.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Has Sue got it right?
You know it? It must be an old one.
He always knows.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
I wish it could all have been different.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Molly!
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Cone.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I agree.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Drink up, it's party time.
Who's your Daddy!
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
How much further?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Is your brother ready to go?
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
That's not something to joke about.
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
But suppose for a second you did.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Perfect.
Really fucking awesome.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Almost there.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Come on, get with the facts.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Fuck your grandmother.
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
I don't hear anything.
A couple hours!
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Where's Bill?
Behold... The Fish Boy!
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I don't know. I only saw one.
Get in... now!
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
And?
You remind me so much of Nathan.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Shall we close up, then?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Gabby, what is it?
What is it?
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Nice night.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal  loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Oh?
Be still my crotch.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I don't know. Something.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
So, how's it going today?
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Good eve n ing lay dees and gent  elmen.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you, Nate.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Only when I work.
Pool.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
That's your problem.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game   he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games   maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might   he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
For me.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
I'll beat him the next game.
Please don't get off me now.
Half.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Why?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
It's quiet.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
How much we got?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Is this all we got left?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
Who's he?
Gimme ten bucks.
You quittin' too?
You better not miss, friend.
How long have you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
You don't look like a college girl.
So why go to college?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Why did you do that?
Why?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You got it all in your head?
You going out?
What are you writing?
No. You?
He knows. A lot.
He's a gambler.
You glad?
What do you want to tell me?
No, I want to walk.
Oh, grow up.
Fifty seven.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Where do you come from?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Very good shot.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
I can't live like you do   all your machines and   cold metal and sharp corners  
Yes.
You want to find them.
What choice did I have   ?!
I only protect myself   !
Do you still want me to stay?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
You and that damned garden.
Only got one kind.
So, what do you do?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
There are more this year than last.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain   it may have  looked  like it changed shape  
Are you all right, Dad?
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just  everything . I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Where, Jimmy?
I swear it was here.
They'll get us.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
No one comes here after dark.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
George, where have you been?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
When?
I have school.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
You saved a lot of lives.
A countdown to what?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
You punched the President in the face?
Pops, you're a genius!
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
You can't go. Call them back.
Really? You don't mind?
You're late.
Was his father stationed here?
So, what do you do for a living?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I don't need it.
But I gave you some this morning.
They let you out?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
How' he doing?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus   you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Marcus!
The Word of God...
Are you expected?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
I'm through!
Fraulein   will you permit me?
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
At least I let you tag along.
No. You like the way I do things.
This book contained a map   a map with no names   precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
It's important!
I'll never forgive myself  
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Found it.
Well, what was left of him.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
...you did it.
They want my diary.
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
My Diary's in Berlin.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Marcus would agree with me.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self reliance.
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad, are we hit?!
Those people are trying to kill us!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Uh huh.
Get that camel out of the way!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels   I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott   my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi  
What?
Who?
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected   the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
You understand what he tells us?
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What's that?
Indy, look!
This is Nainsukh   from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Come one, what's wrong?
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Yeah   and nothing else.  That shock you?
We'll see who gives in first   I'll leave my door open.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
So now they believe me.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Give me your hat...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
My name is AL.
Who?
Al.
You're in my head...
Your name is Al...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Yeah...Who?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Why he's argumentative?
You'll be alive.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
A lab and equipment.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
You need ID in there?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'm back.
What is it?
What do we do?
I don't have any.
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
The beach?
It's sand.
Beautiful!
She doesn't seem to understand.
Help me out, will you?
What do I do?
What?
.
Without your pants.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Get close to them.
Follow that busboy.
Just don't show fear.
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
What is it, your charm?
What Happened?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Some agent you are.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
What do I do?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
What happened?
Be quiet.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
JOE What abilities...?
No!
I didn't do anything.
I knew you were trouble.
How about a deal?
Bit expensive, sir.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
...Foreign service.
It may have been affected.
When you remember...
Don't you want to get out?
Al?
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Don't do it!
Yes...What is it?
Oh...and who is it!?
The poet...something he said...
What's so funny?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Can I help?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
He didn't.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
This business is over.
You know where he went?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
What?
That must be him. Water taxi.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
I know the territory.
Why not?
What happened?
Are you alright?
How?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
It wasn't me. It was him.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
You can't take that.
It will be fine. You have another.
Right there.
The other working.
I'll take some.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
So, what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
I'm gonna do a follow up.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Why?
You ready...?
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
What do you need at the store?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Use the bathroom.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212 555 0199.
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah, I'm here.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
So, is everything okay?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Yeah.
I disappeared on you?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Next to your father?
Why?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Excuse me. Yeah...
You attract a crowd.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No? No, what?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You manipulated me into this...!
Did he hear you?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung specific carcinogen...
Poor communication skills.
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Baby. You are so HOT!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
They say the Massey pre nup has never been penetrated.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey   this is one bad bad little girl.
Well   I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton   would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart   uh, Massey.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
I don't need it.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
You're in check.
What?
Is she Asian?
I have it.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre nup.
Is Tong older than Ming?
  Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
I assume this is on Rex?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
What is it you're after, Miles?
  we are both sure that's what we want?
Getting married.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? When did I say...?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup  
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I have to say   I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
And I'm not used to   Marylin   there's something I want to ask you.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
You do?
No.
But?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I have a surprise for you.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Murder!
Rex. Get away from the door.
I was devastated. Of course.
Miles Massey.
Do you know him?
Lilly's up.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position   we're in court.
You're not...
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
What?
  is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Mr. Rexroth.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
In anticipation of making you sick.
And she has...?
Wrigley!
What do you think?
She owes me a meal.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the   the...
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Three is not Farrow.
How is she?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
South America!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
What've you got against King Westley?
You only met him once .
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What would you like to have me do?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
We've done that already.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would be ex son in law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
No.
Whadda you want!
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
I beg your pardon!
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Of course I do. What do you mean
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like what?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
We could start a two person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
It takes money to buy food.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Aren't you afraid of me?
I don't think there's a "piggy  back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy back" rider.
To be a "piggy backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
Not a one.
Peter
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Sure.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Carrots.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch Hikers Hail."
Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Any luck?
I hope you got your money.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No harm in your coming to see us.
You bet we did.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
SorryI didn't mean to
Up yonder. See the lights?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
If it's on the level.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
What?
Funny couple, ain't they?
A trumpet?
Mush. Mush.
There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Sh sh sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
And Oswald?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Bill.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You still questioning any Cubans?
...give me protection?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Why?  What's wrong?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
And Shaw?
What about Ruby?
No.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Dad, look what I drew.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has   he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti Communist group.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars Chiles  Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance   so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V 2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I don't believe it!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter   a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other   which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Honey, you all right? 
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
My sympathies.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Get a hold of yourself.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
And if you're wrong?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
You don't get it, guys   he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report   and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media   Time, Newsweek, our own NBC   that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
And he never hit you before?
How much more?
Dave Ferrie   you know about him?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail bonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
What'd ya mean?
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
What's she want?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one hundred  dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I don't think so.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know   I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
He's the one who wants you.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name   I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it   That don't give me much to bargain with.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Want to hear some music?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
"American President"
You talk them into it?
I see.
You're avoiding the question.
What do you do when he comes home?
Did you do it that night?
How'd you find out?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
You worked for it   if you're sure that's all you want.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
I thought you were tired of your business?
What if I plead guilty?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
How can you help us?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
...Compton with a fifty six year  old petty thief   woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh huh.
She didn't say.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
What did you do after that?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Uh uh.
How the fuck they know that?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Plus the same deal as before.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I was there, I saw her do it.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Four years?
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
He went to meet that stewardess.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
We're leaving now!
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve fifty.
Uh huh.
How much is there?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Uh huh.
It's Louis.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
Then what?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
They don't have your winning personality.
That's Winston. He works here.
Yeah.
Who's it for? A relative?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Comfortable?
It still sounds high.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out   hey, that rhymes   blew Beaumont's brains out.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
If there's no   what do you call it   confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
I'm alone.
We're back.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
What do you want?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
You're hurting me!
Well, try, huh.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Hey, wait!
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
What do you mean, demons?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
You think they're connected?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Ah!
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub  lime intellect she's living with?
I know very little about demons, Ja  cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci  ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat  tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud  denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
What was that?
Where are you?
That help?
What happened to you?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Thanks.  What's that?
What?
Is that the one who died?
You okay?
Oh, come on. It's early.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't gimme that.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
While you were in the shower.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
You come here often?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
You got a nice tan, though.
Dream on!
Push 'em back.
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
The army?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
Is he all right?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
I don't have all day, kid.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
You see that?
Shit!
Hey! I'm not ready.
Goodbye, my love.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Earth II.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
Rizzo?!
Did you like it?
It's time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
No.
I don't know...sorry?
It's just you and me, then.
Kay Em, you okay?
Kay em you okay?
The power's back up!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Guys, he's right behind us!
My cars. And a comic book.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
Now tell me something I don't know.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Got a pen on you?
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
What? What?!
Where'd you get all this?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
What happened?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
Think the tide's with us?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Is it! The best funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Well... is everything all right?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
What's that supposed to prove?
I'll drink to your leg.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice   your first and your last.
Follow him!
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Is that normal?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I try really hard, actually...
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Did you hear it's yours?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I'm not ready to be a Pop Pop.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
No.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Like what?
Oh.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Cold feet.
Cool.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
You should try Adderall.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Juno? What's going on?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I sort of already have.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Yo yo yiggity yo.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
You're not listening to me.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Juno, what's the matter?
What would be a good time for you?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Are you takin' the pictures?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You took this picture?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
...I don't know.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Brian.
Henry Lucas.
...and?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
So how's it going?
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Carrie.
What's that?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Brian I want him out of our car!
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA LA LAND.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What happened?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
What do you think?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Well, how was it?
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
78th.
You got any money?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Man, this guy is really good.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Nah.
Where you goin' tonight?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
You sure?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Do you like kissing me?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
What do I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Your a real philosopher.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'm coming.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Oh shit.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
I hate 'em.
Yeah?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
Right.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What's that supposed to mean?
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You got it on the board.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit!
Ready for round two?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing   but who called him today?
Hello, Peter.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
And   what path is that?
Hello?
But you said you didn't know her.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Have you any idea what the message is?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die   but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good bye Peter.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Now what?
What is it?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Yeah   that's what we've always thought   but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You must be Erica.
Do you like my dad?
You ready?
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
Anything?
What about prints?
You mean, no prints but hers?
Same as the others?
What time did he get there?
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Where were you last night?
Then I'll transpose.
We got a problem?
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Is this your first time here?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
 but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
That's a very personal question.
You.
Well, I think I've had enough.
They couldn't break the riddle.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I think it's interesting.
I'm just curious.
Of course.
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable   but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I just don't want to fight with you.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
I'm not nervous.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Colwyn ...
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
They have Lyssa!
The White Castle has fallen.
The new Queen lives.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
There is no other way.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You choose these?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
She can see the Beast!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
I can. Because I choose it.
How did you know?
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We could reach it on fire mares.
What is that awful looking place?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Oh, she was so beautiful   and I was so  ugly .
Put me down, you lout!
Passable, pimple, very passable.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
Freylag's stronghold?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A fine match.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
She has the power of vision.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Knowledge.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
I cannot stop the sand.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
OK, I'm fine.
Wow! It's brilliant!
The yellow and pink.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
When I say I love you.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Risky business, isn't it?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Poor darling, and then?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
May I ask you a personal question?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Don't fear.
You can't sit here like that.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so   by the seat of your pants.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
I have to finish first.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
It's a tremendous amount of work   moving.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I do love you... very, very much.
Walk with me?
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
I know where my heaven is.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
What's his story?
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Shit!  He jumped!
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
What happened?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
In a hospital.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy   how long have you been married?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
I really want that watch.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Orange soda?
Sparkling apple cider?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
If I was I'm sorry.
What's up?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
What do you mean?
Sera...
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Why?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
You have been lonely?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one seventy five on your LSATs.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
It's so shameful...
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
So at some point in the   twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
The idiot speaks.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
What if   you know   it's not the night?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more    Serious!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Do they just   put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Good luck.
Aside from that.
Why?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Whoa   Why?
So now you're   ?
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Maiden name   Daniels.  You know her?
Class schedule, map, book list.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a   Marilyn.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
You go where?
Now I am.
I didn't mean  
In court. On opposing sides.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
We come watch... we come watch...
What?
We watch... good fun...
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
My God!  Look!
Certainly understandable.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Is she... dead?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Easily spoken...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Aye... my Lord...
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
A gentleman would offer water.
What shall we do?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Biting you?
Step lively now!
What's this now?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
I don't believe you.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Can you show us the way?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
And video games after!
What's that for?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Do you guys feel like painting?
I couldn't get it to go down.
Why?  What do you mean?
Are you his friend?
I had them in my pocket.
You're a good girl.
Where's your dad?
He's a freak.
I can't even take a shower here.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
We're not gonna do anything.
Josh said...
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
This is such a street of whiners.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I have the permit.
I've been here twenty years.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
George, this is the third time.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I know the feeling.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I loved him too much.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
It's okay.
When's school over?
Last time you were gone for a week!
I did say he could go.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I'm married.
Peter left me yesterday.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Are you going to kiss me?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
We've eaten.
The biggest waste of time since television.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Despite you.
That's the problem.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
No.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Do you know anything about building a house?
You're sure about this?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
No, nigger.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yeah...
She always said that if you were on the outside...
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You know I trust you, Claude.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Engagement ring!
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank telling, loan denying ass, you got me?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him  
Does that mean I'm in?
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
You get ketchup?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Crop duster.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What?!
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Back to New York for starters.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
How you doin'?
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
What are you doing here, mama?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
What's going on here?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
What's your name?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Blacks welcome there?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Where is he? He's late.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Check one two. Check one two.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
What's with that guy?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Schnapps...
Which way did he go?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
The South.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
You have a dog? What kind?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Don't do it.
Do me.
Off limits.
I'm a Sandman!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's  
What other food?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan 6.
You missed something special.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me   and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Where do you live, Mary?
What's wrong, Available?
Well then...?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why show me?
About running, dying what?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us      too fast
I'm afraid.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but    Are you glad you didn't kill him?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
We can't. We're going back.
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
And Sanctuary?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Come with us.
We're leaving.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Well? How do you like it?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
No   just there   on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Very strange.
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I don't know.
You like it?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
You got him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Okay. Thanks.
Hey.
The police called us.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Please tell me.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
We saw you that night, Pete.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
You just gonna let him go?
I wouldn't know how.
What is this, Rogoff?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
No.
That's it.
What's your axe?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
What's that?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Good book, huh?
I called, you know.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
The heart, I guess.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Give that a try.
At sixty?
You like pornos?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Last time I saw you.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
No... I told you.
Why don't you like me?
Sheila...
Hey... Sheila.
All of it?
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Not even a radio?
A what?
Sorry.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Yes.
Uh huh. All I know is   the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Uh huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
No kidding?
Yes.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard   or Mr. Chalmers Bryant   or Mr. Embezzler   or whatever your name may be.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
They were in a quandary, and
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow pokes   I'm starved!
Chalmers Bryant!
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Who?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Please let me help you.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years?   and a very good one.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama   the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri La, since your arrival.
Sondra Bizet.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices   always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Bob, these are all that are left.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that   well   did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Well   I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
What about the porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I   I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
I'd go mad!
This would be funny   if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters   for me!
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Was this your idea?
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm thirty.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
What do you want him to do?
What is it?
Why, he's speaking English.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
EXCUSE ME
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Thank you.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat guy with a hook for a head...
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re introduce myself.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait  let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but 
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Now what?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Jesus...
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him 
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now 
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
After I got the shit beat out of me!
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Nowhere.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals 
They're not even gonna be your enemie a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Found it.
This it?
Kay?  What's your 20?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a high school.
They're gone.
Yeah?  What's up?
He's here.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Why?
I put you away  
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Victim's a white female.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Tell me not to worry, John.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system  
Lara called me.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice  
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Go ahead.
Confirm with trig and image.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
To them.
At least now you   and I   have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
You set me up...
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She was looking right at me.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Stop  
I scored a goal!
Sean  
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
You're not gonna kill me?
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
You don't seem all that proud.
Jesus Christ   why didn't I know about this?
Why?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
You want to bring it down.
Where?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
  and then walk out.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
Which one is that?
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Lamar, I found something.
It's the same prevision.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up  
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
There a maid in this hotel?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Raincheck?
This your work?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any sugar either.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
What was it then?
You know I need to use you.
They've never been separated before.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Yeah.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
...And here is the key to the mini  bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Yes, sir.
Not on me, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
So, wait, you're from where?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Is he cute?
Should I fuck him?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
I don't know.
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I never promised you anything.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Take her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's your record at?
What's his name?
When's it going down?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
How so?
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yeah. Sure.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Yes.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Where is the Soho Grand?
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I think we might.
I gotta pick up the baby.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I'll get the girl.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Oh really. Why's that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know this guy?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You happy?
You fucking nuts?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Let's check out the penguins.
We need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
Eighty five.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I'm sorry...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Where's the surprise?
You want to come splash around.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
What's up, man.
Yes?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where's Spa.
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Stop.
Ow, shit...
No shit?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
Coke?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Here they are, then.
Come, now. You just got here.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Good morning.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Yes. You're going to New York.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
No. I'll take a strega.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Scotland.
I'll get it.
What they call you?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
What did you give it to me for then?
You ain't lying.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Where am I gonna start?
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm  
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I see your point.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67 year old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Brother Earl.
Let's cancel.
Now just a moment, just a moment  
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
If you want to tell me.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
'Bout every other night, Red.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Did you hear me?!
Another one?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You evil this morning.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You will, baby   if the time come.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
You had the number.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is   I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Who the hell are they?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Senor?]
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Daniel.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where  ]
[What do you mean?]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
And what if amateurs try it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
What are you doing here?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Creasy?
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
We're taking a different way home.
Not at all?
You're fast.
Do you think he'll come back?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Why do you ask?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Could I ask you a question?
You don't drink like you used to.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Creasy... Wait.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Yes, mom?
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I could see she likes you.
There's a nice looking little short one for you right now.
Who you gonna call?
Are you kidding?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy Second Street area tonight.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Who told you that?
I don't think I remember him.
Ufa!
Ah?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother in  laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
This is the kitchen.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Where do you think a mother in law should go?
You say something?
What?
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty five   Hiya, Marty...
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy seven cents. It used to be seventy seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy!
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Tommy...
What about the time she wanted to make an old fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Don't you use olives?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Y'all mind the store.
Us. Lead us not into...
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest cutter before there's trouble.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
When will he be able to write?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I was just asking...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Gimme three.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Radar!
What for?
B E R T, right. See you tomorrow.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
But he's got five times the man power to draw on.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
The bastards outconned us.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
You're asking for somebody else?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high pressure you.
Be the longest short arm inspection you ever held!
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Hi, Ho Jon. How they goin'?
The blonde dish.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
What's going on? Who started this?
We got it, men... Ho Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly!
Sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Yeah?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X  rays.
Did you get it, too?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yes!
Who?
Oh. Yeah.
Hello, John.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Can I help you pack?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Did you write this?
How much money do you get?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Looks all right
That's our man. He's made to order.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
What's the idea?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Had any schooling?
Baseball?
Who's got him?
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Join the John Doe Club.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business!
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
How about family? Got any family?
That's a lie!
That's got nothing to do with it!
Oh!
What do you mean, too bad?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re election, too!
No   you can't do that.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Where's the stereo?
What's the line?
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Where's the car?
Who are you again?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
For now that's all.
Open your shirt.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
What's the point of this?
You'd never been out of New York?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
The 6 horse is last.
To run last?
And what about the ones you don't save?
And what if you can't live with it?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I worship you.
That a new picture?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
It's already started.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Yeah?
Hmm?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
Stay up there, Girl...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back up.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
Roper...
What do you need?
It's okay.
Why?
What's happening?
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Divinity?
The new world.
How long 'till we can eject?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
A hotel?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Someone you have to get back to?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit  
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
But I don't know anything about programming.
And it meant something.
I'm sorry.
It was just there.
Tanner eighteen six two nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre De  
Connect to public access.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
I can hardly walk...
Release the power WITH the power.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
Here you go!  No pushing!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
But boss, what about their parents?
Anybody see them?
How the heck?!...
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
The goddamned bastards.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Four twenty eight.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Something came up.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
We'll figure out something.
Like Don Maranzano.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I'm glad ya come.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
What the fuck does that mean?
Where we headed?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Strategy.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick the can on ponies.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Yes?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
How do you get from  here    to  there ?
What's the maximum safe dose?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late night cable.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E  ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare  you  right in the face to get it   and I'd do the same again.
 De nada . Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
DEATH!!
Death! Thank you!
At the moment, yes.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Holy shit.
You know, Julie, even if this works   which it probably won't   that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Uh huh. And?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares   lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a  nightmare maker ! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Bitchin' good cake.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Stu?
It's too soon even to    talk  about that!
Go. Just  go .
 You  have humiliated me in public for the  last   time .
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come  he  goes back and  I  stay here?
 He  got an E ticket. Where's mine?  When do I get   to wake up ??
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Stu...LOOK!
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law abiding citizens just like you.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
He's an organic farmer.
Where to?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Look out for those fellows they tell the truth about you sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row the empty one is for the President and White House guests  see that old couple over there  they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo 
All the ex vice Presidents. You can get ten to one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice President presides over the Senate you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh over there, Senator  on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
 what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being as you say "trumped up" against you!
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and ?
But it *isn't*?
Yes, sir big as life. Been there some time now.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and ? But *no* I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor on a tight rope.
You play left field.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway 
Now, look, kid if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore  that rarest of companions is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Old Don Quixote man of the people Smith 
And I got him all dressed up, too  to go way up in a balloon so they can drop him a long way make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty Dumpty together again 
Well cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Or angry little mountain streams  and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
You know, we're getting married.
Taylor, my dear.
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Fine. The first thing to do is  present Mr. Smith to the press in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute* 
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
What!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me 
Thanks, Governor *yes*! Do you mind? His head Ma'll take the tail.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
A pet shop?
All right, Senator let's get these bags and the livestock together 
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Will the Senator yield?
Has the gentleman the effrontery  standing there convicted and in disgrace to try to force the postponement of that bill ?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I  I'd feel that I 
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh!  Well looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll 
Mr. President 
Will the Senator 
Yes, Ma?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is there's no sense stopping the whole works now  specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through 
What's your name?
Whose statue is that?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Convene that's it yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em 
We're going right ahead with *what*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
That's how Congress or any large body is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Pardon me *this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments more changes and the Bill goes back to the Senate and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against government departments get in their two cents' worth cabinet members budget bureaus embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir the big day finally arrives. And nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I never met anyone more more intelligent or capable. I I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help 
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders   Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Abigail.
Gee I hope so. What's all this?
Do you mean all look look we'd better open them up see what they say here look at the money what does it say "Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say have I got some paper here?
The letters? Gosh no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right  the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Yes right here. Just a second   Miss Paine.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
No. That night I well, *you* know  I was pretty . No Diz is a a sort of brother, that's all 
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is *fight*! 
Ah! That's more like it! What?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
How how do you do, Miss Paine?  I I apologize for looking like this  I I have to be going now 
Oh, the bill. Oh splendid I mean   I I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Order, gentlemen!
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette 
Ax?
H'ya, Carl h'ya, Bill!
I know that.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
 I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam  and what he knows 
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy ! I smelled it!
That's right.
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks  now they're big, green dollar marks 
What do you want, Senator?
Oh, it's all right it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill  it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything 
His first 'whiff'!
Father oh.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan you've made another conquest.
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man by his tone by his careful denials he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct ! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*  !
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Good morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Are you married?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Oh, thank you!
Oh, no, really   I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Hello, Mary?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
The guy's balmy.
You're a fool, Babe.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
You're a genius, Babe   a genius!
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
That's the rub.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
Yes, but you said
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank heaven.
Nuisance value?
Must we have the echo?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Look!
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Now, where were we?
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
No   I don't want it, thank you.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa   you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old fashioned binge?
Who are they?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Nice day out   er, nice night   wasn't it?   isn't it?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Tails tonight, sir?
What do you think you're doing?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this   except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it  
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
That's it   syndrome. So you know all about it?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Why not?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come  
You find it distasteful, don't you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed   "I treated myself too well."
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
What do you want to know?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Hello, Lionel.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What's happening here?
Ph.D., psychologist.
What'd you want?
Finally, some common sense...
I think you know what I mean.
Well... you see, the problem is  
Just who is here, can you tell me?
When did you start to feel this way?
Mom's such a cutie.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're doing great.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Is that when you split up?
Yes! And my ex husband   he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Is it something you've heard about me?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better   which I attribute to you   I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
You got off easy.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was   "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I've got three big ones.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing   well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
"Get to know your therapist."
And the drugs?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
I trained in the east, myself   Cornell   and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
And what ritual would that be?
And how does one do that?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life  
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
Two hundred pounds.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking talking corpse tends to convert one.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
It's everybody's problem!
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
That thing gives me the creeps.
Tough break.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Damn it! That's two down and only two to go.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I knew you'd know.
Um hmm.
Where are you going?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Our guests are waiting.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
We didn't think this through very well.
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee  
Hey, do I look like a Man?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
How's your dad?
He'll never make it.
Have you considered my offer?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
I'm going inside.
Come on, guys   we're fighting against evil.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
I'm liking this.
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses   and it's him!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you   and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time   and what can they can do to help   so you tell them there's nothing   nothing   just leave me alone   but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you   until you just can't stand it anymore!   so you finally open up   you pop like a blister   and it all comes spewing out   all your emotions   your feelings   your fears   all of it!  And then they dump you.
Maybe she's right.
The Obliterators!
Yes, Obie wan.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
So what can I get you?
It's on the television.
I use it... to fight evil.
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
And there's the Sphinx.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
There are none here.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes, sir?
I haven't been there for three years.
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Oh...?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
And now?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
Perhaps   but tell me you promise, anyway.
Yes   what is it?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier   he's cleaning her dress.
Yes!!
But you will not... be safe...
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
You wrote it.
You could hear them?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
What I am talking about is moderation.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Where you going?
Great moves, Day Day.
What you mean talk to her?
Me neither.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K 9's just don't get along.
Nobody!
Who is that?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
She pepper sprayed me, man!  She pepper  sprayed me!
What?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
$247.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
It works.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
How you know?  It could be anything.
You go first.
You go first.
Day Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Karla.
You want us to give you a ride?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
What's the matter?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Hey.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day Day.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
My back.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Elroy, what happen?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Don't remind me.
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I remember you...in the elevator.
For what?
Good luck.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Yes, yes, I understand.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
He's dead?
Come back.
Again.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Lynn!
I have to do something.
It's a twenty.
You remember me?
Please...
Cover your mouth.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
Skate boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Come Back.
Put her on.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf boat...
Leavin', boy?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
What's wrong, Mother?
Who?
There's a little peach brandy   maybe a sip?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Pearl dotes on him.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it   it stank so strong of hellfire.
I tried to save her.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
John...
Where's Mom?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I'm hungry, John.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
I'll see to Pearl.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back  
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut  
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
John's bad.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
The first night?
What do you figure to do?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Get up, Willa.
What's wrong, John?
He never asked me for nothin'.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
How can you tell?
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
You okay?
Guess I did.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
What happens if they don't do that?
Hello?
Bring him out of what?
How you plan to do that?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Did you sleep?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
What?
I must be going nuts...
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy   he's after us in our dreams.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Feeling better?
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
No more fights?
Thank you, Comrade.
Aren't you late?
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
An evening gown.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
You want this?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
The former Duchess!
Good evening, Gaston.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I guess it is eight forty two.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Good evening, Your Highness.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Is this satisfactory?
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... 
If you want to see us you must come later.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
We may have a chance.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
If there is anything we can do for you...
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
You, please.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
I will start with you.
Don't do it, please.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Will you smile?
On which boat?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Go on.
Comrades! Comrades!
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
...and we won't clench our fist...
Would that make you any happier?
No music.
Hello, Leon!
Did you win?
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
You haven't seen her yet?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Imagine the carpets of a self  respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Thank you.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need   because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Hello, Leon darling!
Now, please, Swana.
I just dropped in to have a little heart to heart talk with you.
You leave me no choice.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Sir, the charges are serious   first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
We'll see about that ...
How much do you need?
I agree it's ridiculous but  
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Is it?
To protect his people.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
McCord? ...
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting   he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
We can't touch Hoover  
The country's loving it.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you   it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
June twenty third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Well, why not?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country   don't go any further into this hanky panky, period!
Just do what I say, Bob.
Christ, you're right   Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
What'd he say?
What'd you say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
No.
Ummm...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
So, what's this about, Dick?
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit   "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente"   it sounds like two fags dancing.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Uh, wait ...
Jesus Christ!
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are   that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this   unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Amen to that.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
I'll do it.  No more.
Were you planning to tell me?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war   it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be   you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
What?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How'd you know I was here.
You heard my   you havin' fun with me?
How many a those things you got now?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
How come're you doin that?
Nineteen zero and nine.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Yes ma'am?
...You ride Winston.
That's the boy.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
How's that, Sheriff?
Yessir.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I put it in, Mama.
Did you buy that gun?
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn.
So... for how long do we have to...
Llewelyn  
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You can't afford one?
Promise?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
I can't say.
Huh? What is...
...You getting anything on this?
Airport.
Who is this.
...I know where you are.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
With anything?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Yes.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
What kind of tent?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
...I'm wondering...
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Waitin' for my wife.
Half.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
It's called a transponder.
What did you do?
Cast iron?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
The heroin. You don't have it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Are you in the service?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
It wasn't a woman.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
You must be joking.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty  two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty  two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
The LeSabre!
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Thanks...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're in serious danger!
What's the matter here?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Where you headed, Betty?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
How did you know?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie  
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
What are those for?
You should have a little faith in people.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I'm not some snot nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Really. And where was that, old man?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
That's right.
That is so right.
Now, that's really stupid.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
This is great   just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
We can live with that.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know how...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Really?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Yeah? The sport utility?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
No... before that.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns  
Waitaminute  
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
...Pete?
How'd he know about the treasure?
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R  U N O F F T, but pronto!
Whuhh...
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Deceitful! Two faced! She Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
A miracle! It was a miracle!
We ain't one at a timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
No   you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
Fact of the matter   there never was!
Pete... I do apologize.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit   I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a cump  uh, company accompluh  uh, the fella that plays the gui tar.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Hi, Byron.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Who gave you this idea?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Who's that?
Great ass.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Are you laughing at me, dick brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
What did you call me, Mayo?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Yes I do!
Vietnam?
Something tells me you've been here before.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Lynette, where's Sid?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
There's always a choice.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'd like to come with you.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Hey, you guys still awake?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Do you know that for sure?
No problem.
There is not one thing funny here.
He said open it.
Th  
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Where did you get this clown?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Cell phone.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Can we come in?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Shoulda got an apartment.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
I heard you.
We're never getting out of here.
Call Dad!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I'm sorry.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Those ain't cops.
Alma I told you to...
No...
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Get out of the car.
What are you crazy?
Inspector Brimmer
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Now hold on Rodgers...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
C'mon let's...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
What's the pig's name?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Fuck is up?!
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
My Mom's at that.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
Congratulations.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You don't know him very well, do you?
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you.
Very well, let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners of war.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
What news?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Father...
How old are you?
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred and seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Goodbye, Francis.
How far away?
Reverend.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Seventeen.
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Honey, Church will be fine.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No I guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy 
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children 
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah  I have faith in that.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Was it Pascow?
The one that goes into the woods sure.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
It's Church.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
No need to apologize.
But 
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But 
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
You and this old Indian rag man 
I'll bite what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in 
I'll tell you where the ground is sour the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic baby: Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
  and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and  
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
I heard you tonight.
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
I'll watch my back.
No, I really think I do.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
You have a name, missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune  
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore, I beg you   please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
It's   beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Why would my father send this to me?
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island   immediately!
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
We can at least fight   we might be able to kill a few 
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Dead serious.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
This dock is off limits to civilians.
What's your name?
Move!
Where does it make berth?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Why are brothering with that?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate 
What's that?
Jack!
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
He may be.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's his name? Nebbishman?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Then you still love me?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Haw haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
Is that what Argon told you?
Susan!
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
But you've polymerized single celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by product created by the process.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Do you have something to bring me down?
I could go with you.
No cheese.
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
You made this out of my hair?
Argon's private lab.
You saved my life.
We've got to get the nanobot.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement  
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Exactly.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
I suppose you're going to print them?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful   she'll probably want to kiss you.
Your place?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Do you like them?
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, yes you will my dear   oh, yes you will my dear   you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
No? What do you look upon her as?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm not going!
Go downstairs, and tell them   anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Think of the fun we can have   we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do   I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Ah ah ah!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Fine. Have a seat.
Yale '21, I believe.
Yeah!
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry   will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Right   for the first time this year.
Come on, get going, get going!
What play?
You're my what?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
That's a canary, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
Thanks, thanks.
My error.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters   how's that?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready   and can't get here on time in the morning   then you can go get yourself another job.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Some bicarbonate   quick!
Heavens! The man's insane!
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Smythe! I mean   when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
I just love you in that sweater Mary Sue. It's so flattering.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bu ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Does it look okay?
Oh, hello Betty.
Having kind of a tough time.
Where'd you get this?
What?
No she's not.
It's alright. Let me see.
Like a drum.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Want some bridge mix?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
What happened?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
I think I've got something to say.
What do you mean!?
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Noooooo!
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
They're happy like this.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Are you sure?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
How?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
You're gonna forget about me.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Yeah ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Why would I do that?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Bud ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
TV repair.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Well, I can't talk though  
Yes, I'll be there.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
I know.
Well, yeah, thank you, but  
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway  
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out   what do you think, she's cute, right?
You're so scared.
Tell me why.
Yes.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
I'm going to work.
Me?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No. No. We got disconnect   why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number   ?
Do you know them.
Hi.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Oh My God.
That's great   Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business  
  I'm probably not gonna go though.
This is funny.
Who is it?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Are you learning how to play it?
That was good.
Have a good trip.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Where do you have to go?
For work.....
Yeah.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok.
Why?
I don't know.
I didn't do that.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
The police are on their way.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Can we agree that that is that?
What's up?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today   I have to leave today  
Why you wearin' a suit?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
What's up?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
That's it.
Hello?
What did you say?
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
In part, yes.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again  
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself  
I must grant him his last rites.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create  
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime  
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
It's no secret that you loved her.
Don't confuse one organ with another  
Go to hell!
NEVER!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE  
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
You're a sentimental man.
And  ?
I have.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain  
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
It's a long story, this one.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
This is neither the time nor the place  
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
How was I to know, my darling?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor  
So you ever gonna do a picture?
That poor woman.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t t  teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t t traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t t traps sprung but no mice!
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that 
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Then you explain it to me?!
I just want to understand 
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him 
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
We find the man and then we dissect him 
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Oh Christ...
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years 
He'll destroy us.
What?
Cain   like the Bible guy?
And I'm looking at them   and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
I want you back
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante"   no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Very generous
You're going to destroy it
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES   which has a nice, grand ring to it   and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but 
Pardon?
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked 
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
I think you better sit down
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat 
Oh, no 
You want to do the life of Jesus?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
What's up, Colonel?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
J.R., glad you could make it.
You know?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Yeah  
Go 'head.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You want us to wait for you?
Say what you're gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Whatcha doin'?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
See? That's all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
How's that?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
You know, if there's one thing   I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I dunno.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
No, you're his wife.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is Doyle's house.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night clubbing.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag   And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
His wife took a trip.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
  until yesterday morning.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements   no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I hate to remind you   but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor   I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper  "  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face.   And it's six volumes.
Is   is Anna   who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jewelry?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Oh   that phone call!  I gave them your number   hope you don't mind.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom   it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left   after she arrived in Merritsville   why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
For what?
Swell. I get myself half killed for you   and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss   but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort   and do it right away.
I predicted it.
Stella   in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
I knew it!
That's normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage   with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
He and his wife splitting up?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No.
You know, Miss Fremont   he might just have something there.
What do you need money for?
Yes.
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Yes.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
I don't know what you consider it   but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance.   His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I wonder where he's going now?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2 7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Feel okay?
Machismo?
Just him.
Buzz Gundersen.
Sure.  It's fine.
I like you, you know?
You see any cops?
What time is it?
Tell him why we moved here.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Except yourself!
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but 
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into  it's no place for kids.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's 
Frank!
John Crawford?
I think his first name's Ray I have to see him.  It's very important.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Hi.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
How'd you get here?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
It's me!
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
I came here before.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
Plato?
That's swell.  How are you?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
You promised to give it back.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Plato!
What?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
If he could 
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
See, I'm new.
Yeah why 
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
They'll be looking for you.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Where you going?
Ever been in a place like this before?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Here we are  out of cigarettes  Junior's in the nurs'ry  See how late it gets 
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Is he your friend?
Well, that's the main thing don't you think so?
Plato, where's your father now?
Judy we're ready for you now.
What?
That one?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
How did you know that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Good evening.
Didn't you forget something?
A man of some travels.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Saw me  
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
They changed the layout   whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there   listen to me   guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it 
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant  
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
He wants to see your map.
No.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU  
I saved your life.
What?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who are you now.
Put him in the truck.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A plus.
I had better sex in prison.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
You do.
Do I get a country western name?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
The Powwow Safe?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum  pum pum pum...
What the hell was that about  
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get  Outta Jail Free  
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move  
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Do what?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by  
POP! That was My card!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want  
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I'll call somebody.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What's this?
What?
What?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
Who's your parole officer?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I don't know what, outta my left.
What's she doin' now?
Your name's Freddy something.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Why?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I won't tell them anything. You'll be safe.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess   he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Hello Graham   Joe   Mr. Gardner.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Yes, ma'am.
So am I.
But you eat, don't you?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it   the horse ranch on the Toulomoe   the girl in the spotted gingham.
But the rest is right.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
All my clothes  
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
What was he in jail for?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Can I have my gun back?
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
What did you come back for?
Yeah   but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah, how did you know?
I can't take her with me.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Helen   why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
But I want to stay.
Stop it   stop it.
That sure smells good.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Goodbye and thanks.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Maybe I could start you out.
Gee, I can't.
What comes after Z?
  and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
What do they look like?
How about California?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Ouch!!
Hello Brenda.
Where's Shorty?
Hey, you left your book back there.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
What should we get?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Yes, we made it!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I don't like this, this...
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Would you please focus?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close  up?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
You never could feel your legs.
You're not wearing a belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Father, I think you should rest.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Oh, boy! 
0h, shit!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Chip, honey?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
In here, Mom...
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
He goes to college with me!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Hello.
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Just a half a cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee Wee Herman doll!!
Beverly, are you alright?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do do on your shoe.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea market, where did you go?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer  say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse     used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works   all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I don't like this.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
When I wanted to.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I'll give you a check.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
But tell me  
How's Miss Jacqueline?
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Redi's all right.
And that was all?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
 What have you done about Irving August?
Good night, Jacqueline   good night, Mary.
I'm going to find your sister.
All very nice but, what are you going to do   listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want   surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die   always.
I'm tired of being afraid   of waiting.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner   "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society   a dangerous society...
It isn't that   you said, "have to go." What could compel you  
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something   what was it?
Not I   I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano   "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What was she to you?
Tell me where Jacqueline is   we've got to find her.
Yes. When I tell you.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
What?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
I'd hardly describe It that way   The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'll be out in a minute.
That makes it all the more difficult 
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz   I read what he wrote  
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Oh, uh huh.
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
...free lance. You know.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Why is that?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Why do you say I'm self conscious?
Aren't you?
Hi!
It's a personal project I'm working on.
And they just answer them?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Is he going to see this?
No.
About me?
Why not?
That's correct.
Yes.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to  
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Don't do that.
Because.
Why are you ashamed?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Something wrong?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Bastard...
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
No, he left last week.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
What are you talking about?
I just thought it might  
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
He just asked me questions.
I wanted him to see me.
You couldn't do it, period.
I feel like I do.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
And you ask questions, right?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you think I'm pretty?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
John?
Not today. I've got other plans.
John Millaney.
Hello.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
It won't. I trust him.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plus first and last month deposit.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Well? Supper at my place?
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Want me to breathe deeply?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
How did you come by this scenario?
In a way...
McKinley?...McKinley?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
Brad!
BRAD!
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
Our speciality.
That's an extremely negative response.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
The fuck was that?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra  
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
My condolences.
What do you think?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
They're from both of us.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Hi.
I can explain.
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't  
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
This is rose, right?
What do you smell?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
We should have driven.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Have you no shame?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg head downer shit.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
We're on.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget   your novel is coming out in the fall.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Oh, boy.
What the fuck are you doing?
Does she know about Saturday?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Huh.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
What?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
She tell you she was married?
So what's the plan?
Come on, let me drive.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Uh uh. You're on your own.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Oh yeah? How is it?
I'm having the salmon.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
So what's your novel about?
What's the title?
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Were you ever going to say anything?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go round.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's  his name. What is his name?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That's great.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
How much skin and stem contact?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
So what do you think?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I'm scared.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
It's noise.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
They're distracting us?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Don't touch him.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie talkie?
These are D's; I need double A's.
I can't even imagine.
It's the strangest thing Father.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
What about them?
Okay.  So he was tall?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I don't think so.
Is he okay?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Don't do it!
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Emmett.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
Goodbye?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Jefferson City?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Doesn't look quite fair.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
Who?
What about the law?
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Never will again.
It was not   it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
You can't do this.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Hello, Rae.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I've given that up.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
What is it you want from me?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
It's the only place I'm happy.
That's Kelly, my so called partner. He runs that side.
Yeah, aside from being a loud mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open   can't make a profit without them.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting   in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
I can't wait to meet her.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Hair and make up?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isn't one.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times   young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman   she controls your destiny.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor   to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before   maybe it's the way Simone is playing it   but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love   I think it's really going to mean something.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show   taped.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
My two favorite girls.
... Simone.
As a matter of fact I am.
I just read somewhere  
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Can I see you later   go away for the weekend?
I was thinking   what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Where are you?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
You're with me to be close to her?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
  No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
  We call them "vactors".
Not quite how I imagined it  
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Okay, Dad.
Good night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face to face.
  Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know what you're up to.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you   embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
  I've been here before!   On my honeymoon with my ex wife.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Good morning, Simone.
Maybe he can.
The only real truth is in the work.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Know what?
What kind of words?
I didn't know you were funny.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on 
Yes.
No.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
...No.
Yes?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I told you what I want.
 What?
Don't cry.
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You know that accident up there?
Dead people?
You see ghosts, Cole?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
See?
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Come on  
Sounds familiar.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
You're out of your mind, man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Suzie  
You're... limping.
Suzie... No.
No Mac, please... I  
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p please...
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old   But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What are you doing?!
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody  
What?
Rorschach.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no   I'm sorry, I'm just   I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's  
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Well?...
Driving, talking to me...
Seriously?!?
Anything?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
What the hell are you doing?!?
Yeah.
Mississippi's the other way!
  Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all points.
I'm proud of you.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Why are you stopping?
See ya, Bandit.
Why should I?
But you'll do it?
Twenty eight hours! You're outta your gord.
That means we gotta average ninety  four miles per.  Forget it.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
What are you doin' now?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Loud and clear.
Let's get the hell outta here.
You can't swear on these.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Uh uh. What Cobra?
Five thou.
  Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
  Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Anything on the Swede?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Did he give you his name?
  run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for  
Who?
I did. We   yeah, I know.
Are you on a land line?
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
D'you talk to'm?
What'd you say?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
FUCK YOU!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to  
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
My debrief  
You're finished.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...When did you know all this?
You got clicks, anything?
  yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose  
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Wow.
Shoot.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so  
That takes some of the sting out.
  I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You'll end up like me.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
How much sleep do you need?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched   better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
Don't.
We're taking a flight?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
He has a point.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Hi.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
What did he say?
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
What about Neil?
You asked.
You put me life in danger.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
I do care about you!
Yeah.
Where?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
Do you?
They guys treatin' you all right?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
You still going away?
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
For how long?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Hey.  The neighbors.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Honey.  You got him.
She's got to identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
What did she say the down payment was?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Mike, take it easy...
What did you watch?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
What about when she identifies him?!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Who's Joey Venza?
No, I will not step outside.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Sexual tension...
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Cause if you get in a bind 
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad 
Lizzy!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
How are you doing, kid?
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition 
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider Man  I'll assume that's not your given name 
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
He left.  I couldn't believe it  he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
I hate 
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Well, no.
You'd feel what?
Hello, Liz.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
It's Friday night...
The record 
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza Klein 
Life and death matter. Yours  everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game 
Your dog ate it.
This photo you took of "Spider Man"  
The paper, my boy.  A solid B plus.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
You're sure you're all right.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270   I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a 
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
W w will that do or do you want some m m m  ?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough   one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie   maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us   a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots   so who says they didn't get away?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe   the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army   this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay  off is. Let's get on with it.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
How did he get over there?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
105 353.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Harry   I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Look   if you don't like the way I'm handling this job  
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
How do they know?
You off your rocker?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
December seventh, forty one.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can    Silk stockings?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data, are you all right?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I get it. I get it.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters  attempting to level our descent.
Where is he now?
Can I?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th century, and I'm dead?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Yes.  Thank you.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Is there a problem?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Report.
Captain, are you all right?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Tractor beam, aye!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Response?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Could it be Spock's?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Did your collaborator know?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought   not in his body.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan   the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
The word, sir?
Count on our help, sir.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Why   a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Give me what I want   and I'll consider it...
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Bones!...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will  act  for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information  
You're not going in there   !
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal  
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Bull. You're hiding   hiding behind the rules and regulations  
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Shore leave, Admiral.
It never rains but when it pours  
They even killed the galley chief.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no win scenario  
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
David  
Don't tell me you've got something.
I told you! I told you I saw a  
 Botany Bay    oh no!
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Why didn't you tell me?
No sir! We have Genesis   Whatever you want  
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her   radiation  
Yes, Spock.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed   ?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers   !
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
A distinct possibility.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how  you  dealt with the test?
Indeterminate life signs.
Admiral?
How?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I really must thank you.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge  
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est  
Certainly...
I do this because I was there,
I would accept that as an axiom.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
It doesn't look all that different.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... I don't think he understands...
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Fundoscopic examination  
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
What's causing that!?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name?
Status report, Admiral!
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You mean man...
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
We don't want to be any trouble.
Then  
Or believe, I'll bet.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Hey!   Where you going?!
Well, I... As they say in your century   I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Come on, fellah   speak up!
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock: Condition report!
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
10 seconds, sir!
I have no control, sir!
What is it?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
The whales...?!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles  
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer  you .
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
My people have a strict policy of non interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
No... I want to stay with you...
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Hello, Data...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Your self restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place   so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court  martialed.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh seven hundred hours.
Would you like something to eat?
Worf, you must hurry...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
All injector sub systems are confirmed off line.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
The Son'a discovered an M class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
What you're doing to my neck...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I'm not sleeping well...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean Luc. We've destroyed forty seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Is it Japanese?
No. I will not betray my friends.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction   it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Who are you?
This must be it.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Ready to make a little history?
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What do you want?
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in  
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
I'd say you already have.
We?
Track their weapons fire.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Someone...?
I remember it made me sick.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Thanks...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
He's a DOCTOR!
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
What?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down  
From Starfleet?
She's here   somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Aye, sir.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aye, sir.
Captain, our shields   !
Who is "US?"
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Where?
Captain...
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
What's she waiting for?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
Gorkon's own man??
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
You must have faith.
How did you   ?
Her own father...?
If you are logical.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too   about having faith.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like  
And if they're still in place?
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Why?
Why?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
A weapon.
Yes, sir.
What do you imagine this is?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
Why am I looking at me?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Yes.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
What is our approximate distance?
It's you.
No.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The B 9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI 9 cannot meet those expectations.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
How can you be certain?
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to   everything you can give me.
Prepare for a site to site transport.

To find the head, sir?
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you  
It's working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Anything.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale   I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
Yes.
That's your life... not mine.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
The bond is broken.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
How many Warbirds will you need?
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Then perhaps you will enlight  en us?
Benny, God, take it easy...
What can I do for you folks?
Credit card.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I don't like it, George...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
George... Do you hear me, George?
I just retired.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
What?
Ah... no...
What?!
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Go.
What?
Are you from up there? Space?
Shit.
I will see it next time.
When do you have to be here?
Sun...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No... The closest...
What is hitchhike?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
You can have one.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
What are you saying?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
What?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
The cook again?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
How long will it take you to get home?
Where do you think you're going?
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
To the same woman?
Where are you going?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Is there a reward in this?
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
He has his uses too.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Who did it?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up 
Let's work it.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
2 2 0 3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
I don't deal black jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
I always do.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
What the fuck are you doing?
I thought we were friends.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand 
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
How's Zander?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Those two guys were cops.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
There's a plus side?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless 
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung out little teeny hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Was this him?
Testa?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
Agent Mackelway.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you   I got distracted   the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Hi there.
You have the body?
A grill pattern.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
What?
I've been looking for you.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Its called insubordination.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP   I'll get you the file.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You are so fucked up.
Thanks for the ride.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Doesn't fit.
Yes I do.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
It's a no no.
I've been thinking about this.
He's called a couple times.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
But why this pattern?
Tom, you okay?
You okay?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
What was your weakness, sir?
Suspect Zero?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty five names. A pool of possible victims.
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Yes, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau  owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues"   what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
But why attack an Agent?
I don't think you understand.
You have to put things in perspective.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
What else?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...not until you book it...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty four.
Let me just check on my boy.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You have to lay it on the table.
Why not?
Well, who represents you back east?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
It's a rebound.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know, us.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Hi.
So I don't call either way.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
How many strokes?
I'll give you an eight. 
An eight.
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Oh, like that song...
Then why won't she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Wake up, baby.
They're all skanks.
Cut that shit out.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Always, baby.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
I don't think so.
That's bullshit.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Christy was nice...
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I hear she's getting real fat.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Was I money?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking now?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...we're not...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K  car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
It's on...
It's on.
Sorry man.
...One fifty nine, Two minutes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Be my friend.
Eat it, it's on the table.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You take care of Paulie?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think we'll go for that last place?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle men be clean?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
What was this for?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Godfather, you understand everything.
Don Tommassino.
I know.
Corleone.
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey, beautiful girls!
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
What? What?
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I met him in New York.
I'm never going back!
Good afternoon!
Could we sail to Venice?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I know. I write like a child.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Ha.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
The funny thing   I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something   that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious  
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
I'm well, thank you.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that   can you imagine   the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he really not here?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him   that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
I told you! I knew it!
Peter Smith Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course   from Marge, and Dickie.
Look there's Meredith thingy   who's that, Marge?   They're in textiles... Meredith    God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
What's your secret?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Let's go.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith  Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
My God.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Do you want me to stick around?
Hello. What are you up to?
Plans   good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
What are you talking about   you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the      come se dice?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Thank you.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
You want to canvass?
I don't know...
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What did you do?
That's really something.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy two hours a week.
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
The singer?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No, why?
Oh, are you all right?
No, why?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, this is young   well, I'm never sure how old Black people are   but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Fuckin' One Ball.
Stick up?
Where.
Well... I guess so.
What's your real name?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Don't you want to go?
Can I see you again?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No, I want long shifts.
No.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Stick with Carla.
Thank you.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Limp dick?
Mason.  Mason?
Partners?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
What about you, Delly?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I think  it's worse  now.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Do you... remember me?
Me too.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Nine hundred...
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes it does.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Wait'll you see the inside!
This is the staff of the Bijou.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
And you have sixty eight dollars and thirty seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty five, to be exact...
Luke... what time is it?
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Zackly.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
What is it?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Please, sit.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Ancestors?
I suppose.  Thanks.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
I don't understand.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
I did.
And the second?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Yes, I did.
Could I have a puff?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Mitch, let's turn back.
And the white house?
I see. How do I get down there?
Thank you.
How much for the phone calls?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Whose side are you on?
How long have you known her?
She was selling birds.
Perhaps I'm old fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Yes?
Mother, get a rope!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
We won't be here.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Well, where did he go?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Some of them are.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Can't see a thing.
Certainly, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
Will I be seeing you again?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I have several jobs.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Last night? What do you mean?
It smelled of the fire.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Where are they heading?
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
The power.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Yes, certainly. 
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
I don't know why.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm only a student.
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him   for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more   Burke and Hare and Knox  
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it   who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray  
He's not home.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you   about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But you did promise.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman   closely   it is the very heart of the matter  
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
See that, Fettes?
This is not a woman!
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good day"?
Come, Toddy   come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
But why, Gray? Why?
What did you hear?
"A good day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Crony indeed!
Fettes   where is Fettes?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Fucking Zombie.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
No...
No. You don't.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
It's ok, it's ok...
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
An accident, Nathan.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What is it?
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes   yes, I have.
We had our atomic wars   thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution   that aggression leads to chaos.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Such power exists?
Hi Mom!
Bobby   I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
I mean   on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Are you an FBI man?
Well   Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
You think it can go faster than an F  36?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think they'll ever find him?
Mr. Carpenter   what does velocity mean?
What does that mean?
Go to the movies.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Aw, gee   we didn't finish our story.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator   then subtract.
Bobby   have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
I don't believe it.
How does he explain that?
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President 
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's   it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations   the time involved   the enormous distances.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people   become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Well, we could 
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Tom, you mustn't   ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
But how   how long ?
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Your name's Carpenter   that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license   social security number?
Okay   book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter   if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
 I'll  have to drive!
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
Don't!  Stop!
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
With him?
Leave him alone.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's  dating  one!
Oh, no...
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the  closet monster !
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Ocean air!
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't  
Ohmygod...
Not impressed, are you?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I'm really sorry, Max.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Ouch.
You've got to put this on.
It's gone.  I feel it!
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael?
What??
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Sixteen.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
What you doin'?
How you doin', old boy?
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
MacReady!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Torch them!!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Put that down!
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
What's...
What if it doesn't come?
This storm do that?
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Get back!!
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Ah... no.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Sir... have you a name?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Send him away.
Yes...
Vox?
Why did they built it?
This has to end.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
May I help you?
You're late.
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and   hum, apparently.
Darling.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
Alex...?!
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth  
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four in  hand.
That's absurd  
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
You're up!  You must be feeling better  
His curiosity is amazing.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
That machine  
Is he all right?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Yes.
This is magnificent...
This is where my journey started... right here.
Kalen...
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Yes, sir, he  
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
And roosters.
My equations are not parlor tricks!
He said he traveled for two months.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
We'll see about that.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here  
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Should we be...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half shrouded in the light.
And what's that?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
We're late.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
But I like it I guess.
I think I can remember what's on them.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
How'd he die?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Beat] You bled to death.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Me, too.
They're not here.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
I think so.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
What case?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
You don't understand.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Some part of you suspects   even if you don't know for sure   that what I'm saying is true.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Can you drive?
No.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
This is a great song.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman   that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Hon.
You want anything special for dinner?
Honey?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Who do you think did it?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Alright.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
What did ya do?
Hey, peaches.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Oh my God.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
It means shut up, Thelma.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
So what are you gonna tell him?
What happened to your hair?
Holy shit.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Thelma.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek a poos.
What?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
What?
I said all that?
Thelma, that is not an option.
You awake?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
What?!  What d'you think?!
You're a good friend.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
What in the hell is that up there?
Go.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Nah.
I mean since then.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
Never met him.
Got cash.
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Uh huh. Where was he?
Who?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
We're in love with your roommate.
You should thank me   that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of some insurance dough?
Very nice.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Oh yeah.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies   you know, happy stuff.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum  tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about   ?
That grandmother of yours   she's really something.
Lint?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
Are you okay?
All you want is a phone number?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Nope. Never been.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Miami?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Mary's a mail order bride?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Among others.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You know, I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz   who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico   please!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
I'd go with the seven.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Good lookin'?
Holy shit...
Magda!
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
By the way, how's he doing?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
You look great.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
What what are you doing here?
Yeah? What do you want?
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Oh, still sore about this.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway  
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to  
How long until the army is ready?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
So what've we got today?
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double barrel me.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Bob?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu  Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
  an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
  violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
Were you in Nam?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
What'd she say?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Jesus, you alright?
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table   all I know is we did our job. It's over.
What?!
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two ten, two fifteen  
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is  
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What did he say?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
That's not solid.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Five hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand new shoes, has himself a vision.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
What?
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think  
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
I'll bet!
How so?
Where did you see that?
The what?
What would?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Lieutenant...
Why'd you do that?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
No.
You don't believe that.
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
Looks like a tie.
Well... What   is   it?
Tomcats?
Can't shake him.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
That's missile lock!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
What are you doing?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Ohhh Mother!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
You're not supposed to...
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
What the hell is this?
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I was a victim of circumstance.
Mav's a great flyer but....
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET LOST!
I've seen this before.
Who's the hell is that?
Helping him in.
You didn't help.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
I called your house.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
So, where to?
What happened to number five?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Kill him.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Pull them out.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
They sell fake memories.
No shit...
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
I've got a lock!  There!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Let's do it.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
I'm not interested in that.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
She wasn't really my wife.
What can I do?
Like what?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Knock it off, Burt!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Well,  you're  the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Oh, Jesus!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
What the hell are they?
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take  you  to change a tire?
Its tires are flat...
She likes  both  of us.  We both helped her out.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Ready?
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Gimme back my bottle.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
  Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Look, I'm a lawyer and  
Hey   the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize   dude was banging your wife, right?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Ten years is a long time.
What other case?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Eddie Dowd.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
  Eddie...
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness   unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
A fucking wheelchair?
  Find him?
No. You tell me, Shu.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
'lo, Cecil.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and  
Friday's the drop dead date on the offer.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
It's okay. It was always like that.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
I think what Eddie wants to say is  
What color hair will she have?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
You try that you little monkey.
Phillip?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
He's dead   good and dead.
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
A blue rose.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
I see. He does talk loud.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Take a look at this.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
James called me last night looking for you.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Goodbye, Muffin.
You're not mad at me?
But I love you, Laura.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Did you make me a tape?
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, do you love me?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
You'd think so.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Can I take the car?
Laura.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Who was that?
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
I don't know.
He was accused of jury tampering.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
That's not my handwriting.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Neurology?
...of Anesthesiology?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection!
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I'm sorry...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
One hour.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Maybe I can do something right.
I've got to work...
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Continental Casualty...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You know what happened.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Well, well, well. Huh?
...he's a good man...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
So what?
How are you holding up?
What are you doing in New York...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Did you see it come down?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I stayed right by the door   praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
What was it like?
How'd you guess?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
What'll we say to 'em?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
No, you don't.
What if it isn't over?
Heather?
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
He's on his way.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
In my bed.
You okay, champ?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
You're not crazy, by the way.
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
I want to see the body.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Captured?  How?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
What?
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Carry on.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
There's still a way.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
She isn't that old.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
They were gonna put me into special  ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
You okay?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Why then.
He does.
Why'd you do it?
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
So... What happened?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Uh, huh.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid October.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Oh, really?
And being sixteen.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
What's your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
How would you know?
What?  Come on...
Why, man?
Tie it off!!
Do you have something to say?
No, sir.
What's it going to be?
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Yes.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Need a hand?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
What'd you say?
Gas?
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Hey baby...
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
Actin' funny how?
Sailor!
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
What's that, honey?
M i ss i ss i pp i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I do.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You ready for this?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
More'n likely.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
What's that, peanut?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
It's a comfortin' idea.
Sailor?
Sailor? You know what?
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Six.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Explain it... I told you.
Where? In the leg?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
What?...
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around   till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
You snore.
It's the Chancellor.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
You stay there.
James? My James? What's happened?
Crabtree.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Came to my senses.
No. But I don't think that matters.
No...
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
She told you about...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
You cold, James?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
They're glass. The buttons.
Can I ask you something about her?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Thank you.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
The guy on the phone.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
How's that?
Outside Scranton.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
It feels really... good... here.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I'm not going, with them.
Get out of here.
Professor Tripp...?
So what are you going to do?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's   What?
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
I got the message you called.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Not have it.
You heard? How?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
What's he doing out there?
Sara.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
Did you just make that up?
Listen, Antonia  
Who's this ?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I   just wanted to see her, I guess   Emily. And to see you too   you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this   everything that's happening   it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Hey, is that a school?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Soon.
It's not what you think.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
What are you looking at?
There's a million birds here.
Not too far.  Are you a bird watcher too?
See anything interesting?
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods   real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
What?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
What's her name?
But will he... ?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
You seem a little hostile today.
Why not?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I want to be normal!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
You're very late.
And what are you doing?
Did you get an erection?
What?
Doesn't it get noisy?
I'm not easily shocked.
Hey, that was... intense.
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
You're not joking.
What was prison like?
You really believe that?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
What's this?
What's going on?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Nice shot, Lins.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You never did like being called that, did you?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
What happened?
Fine.  Be that way.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
I think it likes you.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up 
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
Oh God, Lins... I 
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
He's convulsing!
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
I want 'round the clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
High Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
What kind of light?
Used to what?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Well?
Have you decided?
Find anything?
Yes, you should go.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
But where did you finally end up?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Please, you come too...
I'll stay here also.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
And who is this?
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia...
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
What other boat?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Yes.
Because...
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Why?
Should you see a doctor?
Uh huh.
Often?
I don't know.
Down... there.
I fell asleep.
What baby?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like some?
No questions.
You liked Sister Paul?
What else did she tell you?
How did she know that?
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
You can tell me.
She's dead isn't she?
What?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Of telling you.
Why?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Of what?
She said Michael.
So I could go to him.
No...
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
I don't know.
Thanks. 
No!
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
The Catholic Church...
She is not a child.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God...
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
But how did it happen?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Who knew she was pregnant?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Sure.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
That's not your Grandfather.
Gerron.
What's up?
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Yes.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Where are you off to?
What are they saying?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Come on let's get this coffee.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Gie's a kiss!
What's he know?
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two faced John McCartney.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
No.
Now get on with it.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You are.
And my nose...
It'll only get you into trouble.
Temper! Temper!
Well!
Have  you  lost him?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
How's that?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Locked.
Engines off.
Are you in pain?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
What is it?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
What's wrong?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
What happened to the lights?
Where does that go?
Hurt!  How?
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It looks completely different from the first one   it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
All right... but do  not  go below decks.
Where did it come from?
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Yes?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Can you get them back?
What?  What was that?
Oh no.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
That sounds a little fanciful...
They're getting pretty close now.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Still worried?
I understand why you did that.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
Now what?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
This stuff's deadly   I hope we know what we're doing.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
 Hey watch it !
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
How many of them are there?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break up.
MarsCo went belly up on the Dow Jones.
Where're they headed?
When?
Picking up velocity.
Listen to what?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
That's what we thought.
Already working on it.
They've changed their heading again.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
There's still time to back out.
Okay, we're in business.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Four.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self sufficient deep space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
You have to...
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto shop.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you 
I don't think that's funny.
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves   I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I   there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You sat and talked until it was light...
What have you got to do with it?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull   until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
That's not true!
And you realize   you agree how completely you belong to me?
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Let's go sit by the piano.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
I'm giving her a very high class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Just slipped your mind.
Bill didn't say   but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Bill...
Good luck, genius...
Forty five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard 
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught 
Bill...
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it   and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
I love you too. Good night, darling 
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So she seems.
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
Addison !
It's obvious you're not a woman.
It's not nonsense.
I   I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
To Margo. To my bride to be.
It's only for the license. There's a three day wait   blood tests, things like that...
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do   how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind   I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Yes, dear.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
Every day.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
You think?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
You need new girdles.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house   and that even a fifth rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's 
You don't like Eve, do you?
She works hard.
She's loyal and efficient 
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres   Voila.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
You probably won't believe me.
You're going to Hollywood   aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
That's the door.
Bill Sampson? He's   he's a director.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance 
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change   and they become his words   and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means 
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
He can help you.
She knows enough not to be here.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
No, don't go...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things I'll never understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How far to the station?
Do you want it on?
He's in love with you.
Why should he   and why should you?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
With tears?
How was the concert?
Lloyd, what happened...?
That's on time for Margo.
Lloyd, be careful...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
  it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say 
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in   you just missed her...
What with taxes coming up   and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator   well, I've been thinking...
No, I got the idea myself   while she was talking to me...
  well? What happened?
You mean   all this time   she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
What's so funny?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general 
Who's left out there?
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's   still a girl of twenty?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
She's your understudy.
I'm sure.
Hello..
That's right, but I don't understand 
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
When's the audition?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Anything to help you out, Max.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would 
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help   read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure 
 it was fine the way it was 
 and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau 
 Bradlee went to Harvard 
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
Maybe a political operative of some sort 
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
Goddamnit 
And? And? 
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
Anything you've got.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I hate both parties.
Republican?
'68.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
It goes very high we've got to find out where 
 if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again 
 I want you to shut up and listen to me 
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men 
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
I think that's him.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
How many fucking sources they think we got? 
You overslept?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Listen we know you're involved in this we're going to get the story, why not help?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin  he works for the White House.
None of it was my idea, Carl I didn't go looking for the job.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him  everybody's frightened of him Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein 
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
It's awfully hot    and you haven't finished telling me about the money 
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
Something maybe big.
But they both worked at the White House?
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
Same kind of crap 
 I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin 
 well shit, we oughtta be tense  we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House    it would be nice if we were right 
I got Clawsen on hold 
We can't talk inside either?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case 
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House  the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Because the press stinks too history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
What?
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr. 
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
 you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions 
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
What'd you get on W.House?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
 which Young?
Mr. Sloan?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
I'll do it.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Not bad, Chris.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Stifler told me.
Onions?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
I think I've had one.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
You think she was serious?
That's stupid.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Can I come in?
You're not...busy?
Dad.
What was your name again?
Whatever you want.
That is a  nasty  story!
This'll do.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
She's a  cartoon , dude.
You guys got the Latin homework?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
You can do that?
I still think you're okay.
You did it.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Uh...
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Jim...
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Oh, Kev.
Tonight?
Vicky, wait.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Hey...
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
So, do you want to be   I mean, how do you want to do it?
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at  her  store.
I think you need your balls reattached.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Our last game is this Saturday.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou  
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Salots! Shitfucker!
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Fan fucking tastic?
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot in  the mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
This looks familiar...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
What makes you so sure this will work?
I don't know...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Holy mother of God...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Pull over! Now!
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Claude...?
The ADM. Let's go.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
That's not all...  Marcel   Officer Boulard was following you.
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
What?
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Because Gaston was after it.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's  
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Merde.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Saint Severin...
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Where is your home, Anya?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Is everyone all right?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know   I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
Don't you, child?
What?
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
What do we do now?
So where will you go?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs   it was the...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
We've been through this.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Alvy, I...
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine one one, it's the lobster squad.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think   Aaaah! Okay.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
You're jo  Whatta yuh kid  What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sylvia Plath.
Neat?
Uh, narcolepsy.
God bless.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess  I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know 
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna   gonna sing. Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay?
No.
Yeah, 'cause I I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with with, uh, with death, I think. Big 
Those are the two categories...
You see, like you and I...
Well, what does what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
You  Do you love me?
I uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
How  I don't want you to live with me? How  Whose idea was it?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Yes, it is.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Oh, you you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Yeah.
You're so sure about it.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
I'm home!
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
What's  It's me, open up.
Kill it! For Go  What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I  'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Very big spider.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta  whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Happy birthday.
Don't you remember we we we discussed that thing that we were 
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w wanna go to that party?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve  'cause I I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's it's not good for my... 
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, oh, no, I can't I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining room set.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Well, I can't li  We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry 
What 
Where are you going?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Yes.
Charlie Chaplin.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm I'm not a great driver, you know, I I have some problems with  with with 
Just give me the license, please.
Ah.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
How about a ginger ale?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
You fired the cleaning woman?
All right so we can afford it.
Oh, I can imagine. P p probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Oh.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, well, I if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W w w we'll do it another time.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing   one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
You don't have any clothes on.
What what's about?
Honey?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
What is that thing?
Let's get the kids.
He's gonna miss his flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Directing suits you.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
So?
You need to call your dad.
And you know our friends, how?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
We closed.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
You're out of your mind.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
It's an unfair advantage.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Otis!!!!
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Cal, too?
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
No.
Don't I find what?
Joking.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
A little out of my element.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Easy tiger.
What am I, five?
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
Ryan.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come on in.
The charades.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Everyday.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Monica and Ryan.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
What do you mean, thank God?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
I don't have a drug problem.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
So uh   how come I haven't seen you around here before?
You dance...
That's not what you said the  other   night   
What  was  that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
 Insectopia ?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We're going to die!
And only you can become a Queen?
Why do they have you tied up here?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
You new, kid?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No  single  ant matters, right?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Affirmative.
Wow, what a spread   you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
...Not enough food?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term   how about "working themselves to death"?
ARREST HIM!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony... pains  me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
I didn't really do anything   honest   I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week   just for laughs   and right away she thinks you're serious   marriage wise.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen   third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
How'd you make out on the twenty  seventh floor?
Sure.
Eight thirty.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning   a hundred and one fever   then my promotion came up   now you and I   eleventh row center   and you said I should have stayed in bed.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
One more?
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
You all right? What's the matter?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Here.
Your phone.
My head   it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Something wrong with your legs?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I don't want it.
I was fifteen   we used to go there to smoke. His name was George   he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Cut.
Why not?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Are you all right?
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember   I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Worse than that   she was the wife of my best friend   and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless   so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty five automatic and drove up to Eden Park   do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun   well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy   I mean, how do you do it?   here, or here, or here      you know where I finally shot myself?
Uh huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked   so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off   pow!
We're going to finish that gin game.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake  ?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh, Mr. Baxter   I'm glad you're here   I was just going to get the passkey.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office   without overtime.
The Vice Squad?
Where is your apartment?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
You know how people talk.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yeah  
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
On account of me.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain   but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there  
Teamwork   that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all   know what I mean?
Cancel? But it's her birthday   I already ordered the cake  
Want to tell me what happened?
Help yourself.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, wasn't I?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
That so.
Family?
Where do we go   my place or yours?
You got a girl friend?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose bumps just to think about it.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
You don't know what it's like   standing next to you in that elevator, day after day   Good morning, Miss Kubelik   Good night, Mr. Sheldrake   I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
How do you think I felt   riding home on that seven fourteen train?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because   I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead   tell me.
Remember what we talked about?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I have that date   remember?
Is that what's been bothering you   Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I rented a car   it's going to be here at one o'clock   we're driving to Atlantic City.
Just walked out on me   quit   threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk   after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment   especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Look   you know the girls   Thta's Terri   she was playmate of  
Well I mean like they also took our fuel   We've been here two days.
We need all our fuel anyway.
How far do you think you can push   what kind of people do you think  
No   absolutely not  
You make some of your closest friends in the army   war has a way of bringing men together.
Two whole drums  
Winning the war by yourself.
That's good gin.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
I was an FO for the 25th.
Yeah   typical A.R.V.N.
Chef   is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
How?
And the grass?
Captain   they've been probed all this week   Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Smoke !
Yeah, Chef   go ahead   take Lance with you  
Get in there !
I  
Listen.
What cat  ?
I never heard about that.
Jesus   that guy's too damn much.
You didn't like him.
Touchy.
Yeah.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong   54; North Vietnamese regular forces   15; South Vietnamese   28   regular forces and otherwise.  Americain   6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Captain?
I guess this is whAt men of war do   eh?
What's your name, sailor ?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place   a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Captain B L. Willard, sir   4th Recon Group   I carry priority papers from Com Sec Intelligence 11 Corp   I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
What'd you do for supplies?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man   remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
I mean it's hairy   they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy   I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit   ten Cong to one.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Do you know me?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
You've gone crazy.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
I'll never get over it   But I'll always remember him...
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard  
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Right on   he's been waiting for  
Are you warm, Captain?
I'm afraid I won't have time   I gotta  
What show ?
Soldier   where''s your C.O.?
20   CONTINUED:  
30   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
134  CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
26   CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
How long have you been up north?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Had?
What happened here?
Was there any trouble?
What's going on?
Surviving is what I know  
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Have to get these wet things off.
Don't push me..!
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me   stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Alleged killer.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
It's a three hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I ain't gonna leave a seven  hundred dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
Kenai's PA   but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
It's Sam Wilder!
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
C o n s c i e n c e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby sit so let's go out.
How was it talking to him?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Sorry.
Uh, Udall?
I'm not kidding.
What's this?
Okay.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean   I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
No... I'm not wearing that   and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Hello.
That seems like a good choice.
Because...
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon   that way we're not screwy   we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Uh huh...
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
How's Verdell doing?
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Actually, I don't think so.
How you doing, great one?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything   they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Oh, is he dead?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs   Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Now we'll both call him.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Not it at all, really.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Good bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Wait   I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
What?
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
What are you doing?
You can't  
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years   shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov  
So what happens now?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Now what?
Okay.  How did you find me?
Nikita?
He wants to kill you?
I don't need you to get the money   my money!
Why?
Had?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
No.
Do you think about the game?
Not even a stalemate?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
What do you think he's doing?
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X ray machines.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What did he say?
You didn't take it.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
No?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Because, I'll take it.
Attraction is a complication?
Is this becoming complicated?
Was nice.
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
You're very good at this aren't you?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Yeah.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
You wish to close this account today?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Who's your friend?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Well, don't get carried away.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Like helping a sick kid?
Afternoon!
And a tram hit you?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes   anyone I know?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
I don't want to ruin your day.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What about me?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
It's that one isn't it.
Good morning.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents   Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
If you get out can we be together again.
But we could go to London and live in England.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
You mean it's started?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale skin body.
I thought I'd help out.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Shall I wash these out?
Is it dry?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
Why did you break into that particular building?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
What is it you want?
I'll need to make a phone call.
I don't want to go.
That's my bag.
It's more than what you're worth.
What are you an idiot!
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home   I'll see to the rest.
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
That's eight years of school and training   after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
She's like some Puritan.
I don't make small talk  
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You don't know me.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
What's with the friggin numbers?
Looking for intelligent life?
But you think about Him   It   Her.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Oh. Just not at school...
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true  
Like fire.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Stand right here.
You make me feel...
What'd you tell your father?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
What are you going to   ?
Nope.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
I'll talk to your father.
Did you give him a gift?
I'm asking how much.
I care for her.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people   at least for now.
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and  
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
I thought she built it herself.
Now I can do what I want.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta  
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
This is 1952....?
What's N.R.C.?
Hi, Marty.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Hi, Marty!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
No, Chinese food is fine.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Why what?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty   I'm outta here!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act   you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
An atomic bomb.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
You didn't?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Catch!
What'd they look like?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure is pretty.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Nothing.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Why?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Look at all this junk.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Yes.
I'd like to get out of here.
Have you got a better idea?
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Yes.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Then what?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
We will, old fried, we will.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
He offered you money?
Go away.  Let me rot?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Never.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What's his problem?
It's a spittin' image.
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
I see.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his 
Barton, honestly, only the last couple 
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away 
Ever talk to him?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
...Huh? No, I'm 
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
A souse!
I don't understand 
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...That's fine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life  why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
...This must be boring you.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Listen to me belly achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half dozen policies.
Why don't we go to your room 
Hold on 
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Jesus... They can tell that...
Yeah, but Charlie 
...Where did we put him?
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.
There's no smoking in this building.
How is your   personal life?
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
We were in some of the same classes.
Who?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What do you want, Nick?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
How long were you having sex with him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I told you   I quit.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died   that day at the beach.
But you didn't hurt  
Even though you were fucking him.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I didn't.
How exactly did you hear?
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
My wife used to call me that.
Why take the risk?
Did you think it was so special?
You shouldn't play this game.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
You won't believe me.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
What do we do now, Nick?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever engage in sado  masochistic activity with him?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
How did he die?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig assos, son.
How'd it go, son?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Do you remember a case   1956   Hazel Dobkins?
You think I  
I don't give a... flyin'... chili  bean... fart about AIDS!
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
So Nilsen had a report on her   so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
You look like dogshit.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
So what do we do   nothing?
What is all this "Nick" stuff   Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
Now what?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real life coincidence.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way  
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some  
Who are you?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
When's your show?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid career so they could start over as someone else..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
It's in New York.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Would you like to see the wine list?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
You got a date already?
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
She's good.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
You're back.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
... babies.
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
What's that?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
I really... admire you.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
See you later.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
That one's for you.
You don't have any!!!
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Admiring your handiwork?
Well that's a ... long story ...
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold  plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Let's make a deal.   Other  than my blood, what can I off 
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce   Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man woman, cat mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful...  penguin .
You buy this "blurry" business?
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
I don't.  So, no.
Big giant  capacitor .  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be       sucking  power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
You certainly will not.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
He's over eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
I am as well as can be expected.
I love you, old man.
It's good to see you.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Nice suit.  And today you are?
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
Umm hmmmm.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Winded, old timer?
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
And?
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Who's Ivy?
What happened to his wife?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
Like hell you do.
Hail the all knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
What say we turn up the heat?
How about dangerous curves?
You should have heeded your pointy  eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
Letters in the alphabet.
What now sir?
Up here, Al.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Mr...?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
That kid is amazing.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Why do you do that?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It . What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
You can't .
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out cog nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
...or death.
How'd you find us?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Holy shit.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
How high up would you say that is?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
Thank you, Vicki.
How'd you find this place?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
That's how it is, chum. One column   and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
No.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We      You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.    Maybe he don't know what we know.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs    
My brother's a priest, man.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break in?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
No.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around   in his cape   on a rope.  CRAZY BAT STARD!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Here, let me do that.
Goodnight Annie.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Oh yes.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
It's very good Bernie.
And howls Alison?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here   and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face lift.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
All the guys they claim are English to and good looking like Dan Day  Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Well, there is that ...
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
off the peg?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Hey Butt Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
No way butt hole! I want the window.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt Head, TV!
Ow! Cut it out Butt Head.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Hey Butt Head it's that chick!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Shut up, dill hole.
Um... ass... head...
You already said that, Butt Head.
Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hey, Butt Head, it's that slut from the plane!
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio o o o o o!
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You scored with two chicks?!
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to  last ?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
My God, we're back where we started.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
But  we  let him out.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
 You  did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Just get some people out of our house.
Just one daughter.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have  killed  him.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you a hoo.'
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So  simple .  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Your name is  Beetle Juice ?  Yecch! That's as bad as  Deee lia  Deee tz.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
It's  Otho !
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest  
Look at all that  parking !
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
They're... not here anymore.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Don't you  dare .
What do you think?
 Oh my God !
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and   perhaps   only perhaps   think about an inground pool   the place  might  just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Is this the key to the attic?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Otho, that's terrible.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
Their wedding clothes.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
An attorney?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... And please call me Robert.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Good God, Eve   you'll freeze out here.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor   what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously   but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
A Black man gave me the message.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal   why, it might be hours before you are treated...
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Chauncey...
He's tired, Chauncey   but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... Come in, Chauncey   please come in...
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
... Are you sure you like it?
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down to earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues   so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner   do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
I feel very good in here.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Bravo!
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Hah! It's all make up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey   I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
This is terrible, sir    I hope you're not badly injured...
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
How long do we stay in here?
... Evening, Chance.
... I see.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance   but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address   a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty seven years ago.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Correct.
... Sid, be reasonable   I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
You heard?
... Ben, really...
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
No! He's a real gardener!
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
And put it through on a Code Red   I want it as soon as possible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
... So what does all that add up to?
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
My God!
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Pardon?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Moving story.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Why not?
Who told you?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
That's the usual?
Hi.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
I've fallen in love.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
No. Don't be an ass.
Vegas? What'd you think?
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Do you dream often?
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
You know I think it pays to leave juice making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
You still there, sweets?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz   The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Bad dream, darling?
Yeah what?!
Captain Mertin?
You still know.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
I want somethin' sweet.
Well, good luck with the job.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Morning.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
True.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
What run him off? Tell me that!
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You remember your price, Stamp?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You shaved.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Hey, man, I'm not 
Jesus fucking Christ.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Excuse me?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
Almost five!
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Kill that poor woman.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
 So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially 
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
They're not his, heh heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner city children of promise but without the 
One oh!  Heh heh.  You never went to college?
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT 
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
"Johnson"?
Huh?
You mean coitus?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
And please don't call her my mother.
Well...yeah 
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's 
And then. . . let's see, I uh music business briefly.
Increases?
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call 
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
The fucking point is 
The what?
Walter what the fuck are you thinking?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
...Huh?
Walter!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain 
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand  off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna  they're gonna 
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our  selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is 
That makes me feel all warm inside.
They're nihilists.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In and Out Burger 
Uh huh.
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Oh, shit.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What's mine is mine.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together 
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Bullshit. Walter!
I'm not 
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
how long since he was bitten?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
What do you want me to do?
You came back for me.
What do you think?
What do you really think?
Where were you, Whistler?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
And so will we.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak    Where did you get it?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Nomak?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Any casualties?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum  
Get in. Youre leaving.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
No longer.
You shouldn't be here.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career  
But, he could've  
But he's a policeman  
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner    This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now  
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Get out of here  
How's it going, Kam?
This isn't human blood.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half breed"?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
You're a monster.
What   ?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings who  cares ?
What do you mean?
No.
 Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds 
Domini?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission get the "feeling."
Yeah, so?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Druid Hill Park.
 the witch kills children 
Cheery little place.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy 
 chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
 now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel 
Nothing. I dunno 
Oh, Jesus, no 
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
From the movie Mary Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
No fucking.
We should be so lucky.
Where  is  it?
Where's Domini?
 into the  Black   Hills  with 200  something miles from here 
Who?
 Cotter 
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
Just one lock in this neighbor  hood?
Well, she's got to be  somewhere  here.
Why was  she  exempted, Nick?
She got  paid .
Pointless.
Someone want to tell me what's going on 
What?
The good old days: toasting marsh  mallows over a burning witch.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little 
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna 
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what ifs.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
She's far from "fine."
"It's why the witch kills children."
 yes 
 yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else? 
Your mother's pastor.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...Ray?
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
On the phone. Was it for you?
...Well I'll be damned.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
Well... what happened?
...Where is everything?
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What night is it?
I told you. I like you.
Sign.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
...Anything else?
I'm supposed to do a murder two murders and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...What?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
What's this?
Got a problem, Meurice?
...Why?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Where was I?
What day is it today, Angie?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
To your health, Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont   I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont   Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man   this well dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Not yet.
Who's this fuck?
Can I feel 'em?
Bull.
He's comin' back?. What for?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin   let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
Who is Don?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Come in.
Yes. Frank 
Do you like my body?
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Hold me, Don.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Oh yeah?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
What happened to him?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
What's the plan.
Brilliant.
I'd like an ice cold Heineken.
Okay. thanks.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Shoot.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Okay.
It's good to see you.
NO.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
I should go with her, Sandy.
... Sandy?.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Well. Okay.
No.
Well.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Greetings, Mr. George.
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Should we buy it?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Excuse me?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Mirtha.
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty five pounds in each bag.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't think so.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One point three five for the Colombians.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
What do you got there, Diego?
Twenty six months.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Oh my G d.
I know.
George.
There's no room.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Derek Foreal.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Cocaine?  How much?
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Un rata   no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Freedom.
George, you look terrible.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Look what the cat dragged in.
I don't know.  My name is George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I swear.  On my life.
I fucked up.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
In Indochina,  they  won.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group. What's your assignment?
With an unloaded pistol?
I don't do that kind of thing.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Go away!
To show them to the UN, right?
Where were we?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
What is she saying?
How you doin' Mister D?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
So she knew about his heart?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Then how did it get into his body?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Objection, Your Honor.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
What about Miss Lawson?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop   to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
Did you suggest any?
  And what did you suggest?
Well   as I remember it, we had an argument.
Yes.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
How do you know that?
Yes   he mentioned it.
I suppose.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Dristan nasal spray.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
Frank!
Can we get out of here?
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Yes   it would be nice.
You and me   making love.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
What are you going you doing?
You killed him   didn't you?
You killed him.  You killed him   and I got you off.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing   and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
I love you.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Really.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Humped
Frank   I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I don't know.
It's more involved than that.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Did Marsh use it?
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Carolyn   you want these candlesticks?
Lawyer here?
What?!
"  going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives  
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
What are you doing?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty one.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa   very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
He's very... clean.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
I'm sorry. That was...
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You really don't need anyone?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
It's Robert.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is  
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
What do you want me to say?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself   she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand   no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children   in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
About an hour ago.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw  
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You want us to move in here?
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Where's the others?
Where's the gangsta of love?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Yeah, we used to do the after school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Jimmy, you've got  
I want you to do something for me, baby.
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
It's alright, baby.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
We'll have to sneak in.
Are they on the radio?
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Not really to live, just to play.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Open the case!
How the fuck can I open it?
Caesar?  What is this?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They just left, didn't they?
It's impossible!
Violet, please!
Where is the money?
Stupid cunt!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What did she do to you?
I saved you.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Is that the money?
Un fucking believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Who?
Oh, I'm sorry  
Yeah.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something  
No.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
What's wrong?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Because it's the truth.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
You said he washed the money?
What happened?
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
It's me.
I was so afraid you ...
How'd it go?
Done.  We go now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
  he went inside!  
Forget it.
So now you know.
Keep it. 
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture swaps.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
His brother.  You know his brother?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really   I was quite   I was surprised.
Was it the break in?
Jesus...
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
We're about an hour away.
Okay, so...
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Marie, just      just stay there!   just  
He's dead isn't he?
What is that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What about you?
Yes.
It's an angle of the street   some sort of alleyway   you can just...
  but it was  him   
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
You drink rum?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
...ervices.
...Be back.
...ixed itself.
What have you got there?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
You are late.
Triplets.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard   congratulations!
How much do you know?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip  up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What's she done?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Trust me.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
Don't litter my cab!
Yes, of course. Sorry.
What's going on here?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Security.
Shit! The house is on fire!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Oh my God, a mistake!
But if they did promote you
Try next of kin.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
That's it.
Can I forget it?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I know that.
What! Shit!
Lime, I need to use your computer
My mother said it would be all right.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
What were we saying?
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Uh ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
Now look what you've done to him.
What the   ? How did you   ?
Sign here please.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Can you fix it?
What do they want you or?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank Pierce.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
IB Bangin.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
He's very very sick.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Sleeping.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
Who is it?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Who's that?
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Three legs.
Backup?
I'll drink to that.
No.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
Tom, where are the Band aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Whatja doing?
The brakes are shot.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You're in the stomach!
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
He excels at gratitude.
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Eventually rising to...
Nine seconds.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him   and maybe Tom should say that our F 14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma   did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
I read about it   that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
How'd it go?
Then what was good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Okay.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Did you hear what I just said   do you have that?  Take a breath.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Because...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me   we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi   he reported on the Eight one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Yes.  My room is down here   I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really   a lot   appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
So he was indicted?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Nervous?
There's no gang in there   We were the last ones.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
I'm not sure I dialed right   Jane?
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
So what did you think?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
What?
That's not it.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time   but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
I got promoted for things like that.
That's not going to be the way we say good bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten   it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
This is very awkward.
Look, I'm junior man   and it's your beat.
I converted a bedroom   this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough.  That's enough.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
It's kind of dark  
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Walter can I ask you something?
Alright we're clear.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
See you later  
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
More champagne, your majesty?
Did you hear what he said?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Walter...stay away from me!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Are you alright?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Walter, what are you doing?
Where'd ya buy that?
Yeah.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
You didn't mean to what?
It's hot in here...
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Police officer.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any  
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling  
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I won't say good luck, Walter.
It's like...you've turned on.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I will   good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Nice to feel needed.
Man has a complex.
No, we didn't.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
It's coffee.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Did you see a girl come by here?
Wheels?
Hi, Buffy.
He doesn't look fifty.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You left me a message?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
You want some water or something?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Well, stay here tonight.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I didn't expect to see you.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
I'm going out the front.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Bugs.
Like what?
What are we doing?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Just stay away from me, okay?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Meet me at this address after school.
Why do you keep saying that?
What?
Not a pressing issue.
Uh... gym.
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight   harder than you've ever worked in your life   and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
I want to die.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
The mark of the Coven.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Write that down.
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Buffy, the ape woman.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
How was that?
I'm yours.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
That's my leg.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
What'd he say?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Neither will I.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Your place or mine?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
And now you wanta teach me?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Annie  
Oh no he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
God bless you.
You missed the tag!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Why you shaking me off?
Fastball.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
How come you don't like me?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You could be one of those guys  but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
You're weird, man I want a ice skater real bad.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
You will.  Look, Nuke these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile  don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I don't believe in fighting.
I'd kill ya.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Well tell 'em, honey.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Struck out eighteen...
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores it's nasty, nasty work.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
I was never   I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
A powerful man.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten year backlog.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Okay.
Hello.
Now this is just a signature card.
No, tha that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
Yeah.
No, of course not.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha  I'll   I'll never let him in the place again.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
In other words, I'm fucked.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
No, no it's okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
What   what, Caesar's?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
I just told you. She called me.
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Are, uh      are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Half of everything is mine.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
...position...
It's always been our policy  
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
We need this guy.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I care about you, a   But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Oh, it's so soft.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Twenty five thousand? For yourself?
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think  
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...under?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
With Jennifer.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I was with somebody.
I want you to let me go.
Get   get up!
I wouldn't  
I am not!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like   ?
Loose machines are right back over there.
All right, I will, I will.
Well, I... I never tried.
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
You know where she gets this from!
What expenses?
Yeah, that works out.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Can I go in?
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Oh.
He's not here?
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
What? What?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
No, he's not.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Great.
...same outfit.
Come on.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Bub ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
  with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I  
He's sittin' by the phone  
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy  
  back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
They checked in alone.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Wow.
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Mm hm.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Come here, come here.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
This is Nick.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Mm.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Take it easy!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Again!
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Yes, uh...

How heroic of you...
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Women, huh?
We're waiting.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Catwomen. Lots of them!
What do you want from me?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Boss man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
God damn..
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Car wash, Captain?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark  Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
I loved you.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre Bicentennial babe...
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
I don't know what came over me.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night good food, good conversation some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Okay, deal.
You're late.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
What's this?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a  Hockney .
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Lose the hardware now.
Any minute.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying  
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Who smashed the phone?
I don't want to know  
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
26th off Wilshire.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Hey drop it, okay?
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
What's happening?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
He's copying down my license   for all the good it'll do him.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Do you know what's in that box?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
You can't give up.
What did you do?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore   but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before  
Yes sir.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I'm still okay.
Do you think they'll walk away?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Any idea where you're going?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
What's your point?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Five ... six.
Oh God   Oh no   Help me   Don't let me   Die.
Don't leave me here to die   Theo, please   you can't let me die  
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
They saw you kill the driver.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
You should've done all this before.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
And then?
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Seems like it.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up   that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Yeah?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
I'm in awe.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
The 405 is coming up.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
What you think?
Saw that one.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Maybe he wants something.
He's back, Col
Cunt. Scrag eyed dyke cunt.
Take your clothes.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
No.
What was that?
You all right?
He's getting up.
Someone out there.
You want to know how I kissed him?
Do I?
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Tell him it hurt  
Sure I do.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
How?
Do they know?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
What you doing, Jimmy?
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You didn't.
You tried.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Then say it.
What would you do for me?
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
She was  
Yes.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon  
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Leave us, Judie.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Of course. I forgot.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
So?
Why?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional   you understand, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Hope not.
No?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What makes you think that?
She's a friend of mine
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
We don't look on it like that.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Is it bad?
Don't know her.
What?
Help me.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro  
Don't run off, Jude.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
I never know nothing.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty fifty chance.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus  
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it   at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
as outlined in report number three  nine stroke five two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22    no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs  lyses! Adam   that was it! The garden!
Now what?
Reggie   trust me once more   please.
Central Intelligence Agency   C.I.A.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert  
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right   you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert   you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim   you look for it, Mrs. Lampert   I'm quite sure you'll find it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Carson?
Mr. Bartholomew   why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
No.
That's a face you don't forget   he was there too  
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked  
Around one.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to    marriage license! Did you say   ?
You did too say it   I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam   I mean Alex   er, Peter   Brian. I hope we have lots of boys   we can name them all after you.
Sorry about that.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here   to ask me that? She has it   you know that.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Your  
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians   the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Said what?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I'd love some, thanks.
Reggie   open the door.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe   any requests?
Reggie   you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
No   not yet.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you   not now.
Monsieur Flix   ?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one   a Swedish four shilling   called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen'   issued in 1854.
The best for the last   le chef  d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien   I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
